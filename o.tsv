O enredo se desenrola a partir dos esforços científicos de um importante médico português, o dr. Simão Bacamarte, cuja obsessão pela busca de um método universal para tratar e curar distúrbios mentais leva os habitantes da pequena cidade de Itaguaí ao terror, conspiração e a tentativas de revolução. Em pouco tempo, o hospício do dr. Bacamarte passa a tratar não só os doentes mentais, mas também os sãos, que, segundo o diagnóstico do médico, poderiam vir a desenvolver doenças mentais. O Alienista tem como tema a crítica ao cientificismo arbitrário e sua influência em elementos políticos e culturais. The Psychiatrist is a tragicomic literary piece on madness, scientism and power. It follows the scientific efforts of Dr. Simão Bacamarte, a prominent Portuguese physician whose obsession for discovering a universal method to treat and consequently cure mental disturbs drives the inhabitants of the small town of Itaguaí to fear, conspiracy and revolutionary attempts. In a short space of time, Bacamarte’s madhouse passes to take inside of its walls not only mentally ill patients but also healthy citizens who, according to the doctor’s diagnoses, are about to develop some sort of mental illness. The Psychiatrist stands out as a highly ironic critic to the arbitrary of Scientism and its influence on cultural and political matters.

The O'Halley Brothers' sets are a successful mixture of soaring melodies and reverberating bass, which creates a diffuse collaboration between House Music and its many variations: Dirty House, Electro House, Tech House, Progressive House and Tribal House.

Radio Network does not merely consist of a series of self-help programs; each show is designed to take “real-world” issues and translate them into ways of empowerment, easily understood at “street level”. Each O.N.E. Radio program is supported by a well established and loyal listening audience, with show hosts well respected in their fields of specialization. The goal of O.N.E. Radio is not to produce and air shows based on guessing what will or will not attract an audience; but to take a variety of content that relates directly to audience needs, put it in the right form at the right time, and use this information as a tool to develop personal connections, thereby empowering listeners to make their best decisions. O.N.E Radio maximizes the use of a variety of social media platforms as a comprehensive extension of each live program, making each show available to anyone, wherever they want it, whenever they want it. The shows produced are programs extended in the spirit of excellence, whether there is one listener or one million. We believe this approach will develop and expand the audience base in the long term as each program stands on its own merit and has integrity of purpose. Conversely, the audience appreciates the “being true to thyself” philosophy, as the shows are authentic in subject matter, as well as interactive between the hosts and their listeners.

Usando o recurso de uma narrativa ficcional O Seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado toca em questões normalmente guardadas a sete chaves nos bastidores dos centros de poder, no andar superior das instituições religiosas onde circulam apenas os chefões.
É nesse “andar superior” onde planos são elaborados sobre como continuar explorando o povo de Deus, onde as estratégias de marketing e contratos comerciais são assinados. É quando as máscaras são tiradas e o Povo de Deus é tratado como segmento comercial-religioso, fonte de lucro aos “vendilhões do templo”.
O livro começa com a vinda ao Brasil de Harry Screwtape, um alto executivo de uma holding controladora de vários grupos relacionados com desenvolvimento espiritual, sediada em Londres e com ramificações em todos os cantos do mundo. Ele vem ao Brasil com a missão de investigar a existência de uma “nova inteligência” cristã, um movimento emergente que atua no underground e se prepara para virar a mesa para cima do status quo Gospel. Harry Screwtape tem ordem expressa para identificar o foco dessa “nova inteligência” e neutralizar seus líderes que trabalham para resgatar o Rolo Sagrado.
Proteano, personagem que ocupa um lugar central na história, lembra um pouco cada um de nós. Sua busca pelo mistério do Sétimo Selo, mencionado no Apocalipse, último livro do Oráculo Sagrado, faz com que o leitor se torne seu parceiro nessa empreitada.
No cruzamento dos destinos de Harry Screwtape, de Proteano e das instituições religiosas, encontra-se uma linha tênue entre a ficção e a realidade.
Os “vendilhões do templo” começaram de forma ingênua e despretensiosa profanando o Sagrado e colocando o nome de Deus em sandálias, canetas, camisetas. Ficaram tão bons no ramo que foram pouco a pouco transformando Deus num mero produto comercial. Convenientemente fecharam os olhos fingindo que não era com eles o seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado.
Como se não bastassem as sandálias, camisetas e bugigangas religiosas de todo tipo, partiram para a compra e venda de cidadãos influentes na sociedade, políticos e empresários, líderes religiosos e eruditos. Gente hábil nas palavras e no uso da imagem; com aparência de ortodoxia atenderam os interesses de quem está no andar “andar superior”. Já estão bem próximos do centro do poder e prontos para usá-lo sem o menor escrúpulo.
Para que isso não aconteça é preciso desfazer o seqüestro do Rolo Sagrado. Na medida em que a trama se desenvolve o leitor percebe que foi levado pelo clima e por desdobramentos surpreendentes. A conexão do texto com a realidade é intuitiva e ao mesmo tempo recheada de sutilezas.
Qualquer semelhança poderá não ser mera coincidência."	""

In the mid 90s Dave resided in Sao Paulo, Brazil @ Club A-Loca for some time before returning to the UK to play at numerous venues along the South Coast, at club nights such as Oceangroove, Flylife, Wicked, Maison Profound to name but a few &amp; also to be a guest on dance radio shows such as NRG FM &amp; Deep Blue FM. 

When it comes to his style people have always found it difficult to pigeonhole him into one genre of House Music, but rest assured it will always look to have an underlying deep phat basslines, a dash of vocals &amp; at times a nod to the house past, but the main element will be the overall sound that will make you wanna close your eyes &amp; move! This eclectic deep funky house sound will feature in his mixes over the coming HouseLIFE series....hope you enjoy the Oceangroover sound and feel free to leave your comments or to simply say hi from around the globe ....  peace x

Octex's (aka Jernej Marusich musical path started in late 90s, when he fell in love with the sound of old analog synthesizers and started conducting Organic Crackle and Tone EXperiments (Octex).
His debut album Idei Laehsna (Tehnika records, 2002) received high praises from both critics and the public and got proclaimed as one of the best post Basic Channel dub-techno releases. But always looking forward his next album Variations (rx:tx, 2005) took his experimentation even further and deeper, which confused some of his fans a little, but gained him new ones, and got him some really good reviews in the press.

In the mean time he has lent his remixing skills to the likes of Laibach, Ultra-Red, Marko Furstenberg, Spyweirdos...

2008 will see the release of new EP and his ambient album Dead Center of Nowhere, originally recorded as a sequel to Idei Lahesna, but till now never released. It will finally see the day of light as a shared release between proclaimed Thinner net label and rx:tx.

In 2003 he has received Slovenian Boomerang Award for best new comer of the year, and in both 2002 and 2003 he was selected as one of the 10 finalist for Radio France International Electronic Music Award.

His live sets have taken him all over Europe to events such as: Club Transmediale (Berlin), Sprawl (London), Dispatch (Belgrade), Exit (Novi Sad), Cynet Art (Desden), Meet Me, Progress festival...
In 2008 he will be presenting his new audio/visual performance. Having already done video for his tracks (which also ended being played on Viva, Onyx TV...) he had developed a system that allowes him to automatically sync visuals to his improvised live performances.

Hidden behind the name Octex is the Ljubljana-based artist Jernej Marušič, who started appearing under this name, a shorter version of Organic Crackle and Tone EXperiments, in the late nineties of the previous century – as a follower of contemporary currents in electronic music and a lover of analogue sound synthesisers. His first released composition ‘Nigljana’ was included in a varied compilation of Slovene electronic music Elektrotehnika Slavenika from the year 2000, which was issued with wide acclaim as a supplement to the British music monthly The Wire. His LP debut ‘Idea Lashna’, by and large one of the most groundbreaking and creative achievements in the Slovene electronic scene, was released in 2002 under Tehnika Records label, having wide reverberations also abroad. The critics recognised it as a top-notch product following the stripped-down aesthetic characteristic of musicians signed under the German label Basic Channel, while the album offered a finely tailored mix of techno, ambient music, and dub as an echo and a reaction to contemporary, nervous sound landscape of urban circles. The album earned Marušič the then influential Slovene music award ‘Bumerang’, awarded by Studio City programme of the Slovene National Television, while in France it was voted one of the ten finalists for the electronic music award presented by Radio France International. That said, Marušič’s music making does not stick to proven recipes and a solidified sound aesthetic. In an on-going, restless search for a new sound, Octex absorbs various trends that schizophrenically spring from the field of electronic musics, incorporating them again and again in its own music in a distinctly unique and recognisable manner. Already with his next album ‘Variations’, released by RX:TX in 2005, Marušič found himself in an altogether new world, which drew on a tense and intense techno connection between Berlin and Detroit, traversed by dub, soft sound textures, and complex, seemingly unstructured rhythms, with which he stepped out of the prescribed matrix 4/4 and which have today become a trademark for Marušič’s work. Around that time, Marušič also started to regularly appear live; he did remixes for well known artists, like Laibach and Ultra-Red, while reverberations of his work also took him across our borders. He performed, for example, in a London-based series Sprawl, in Club Transmediale in Berlin, in Dispatch in Belgrade, and at Exit Festival in Novi Sad. With the album in question, Octex also signed to the home RX:TX label, in the frame of which he performed alongside artists under labels such as Raster-Noton, contributed tracks to two international compilations ‘Progress’ and ‘Progress EX 0.4’, both released by the mentioned label, and was featured on a highly appreciated Slovene compilation ‘Trans Slovenia Express Vol.2’, dedicated to the cult band Kraftwerk and released by the British Mute Records. Earlier this year, RX:TX released Octex’s long-awaited new album titled ‘Every Sound Tells a Story’, which is this time lined more explicitly with an analogue sound of modular sound synthesisers, sifted through digital technology. Individual tracks from the album were inspired by fieldwork recordings, which are in a processed form blended into each track. Dino Lalić, a music critic for Radio Student, wrote the following about the album. ‘Its sound readily admits techno, dub, and ambient influences, with none of them standing out in particular. The fact that these influences remain merged offers a myriad of interpretations. Nobody is right and whoever says he is – is inevitably wrong’. These words fitly capture the essence of the restless, yet sound-wise well-tailored creativity of Jernej Marušič, which he lately also incorporates into improvisation, both in his solo performances and in his work in the trio Ago Tela, which includes, besides Marušič, also DJ Dojajo and Mario Marolt, while at the same t"	The project ZVO.ČI.TI.

ode-an-by-tahirih-and-browne-edward-granville	Ode, An by TáHIRIH and BROWNE, Edward Granville		https://librivox.org/rss/4027	http://librivox.org/an-ode-by-tahirih/	LibriVox	info@librivox.org	""	""	false	"<p>LibriVox volunteers bring you 13 recordings of An Ode by Táhirih (Fátimih Baraghání) (1814/1817 – 1852), Translated by Edward Granville Browne (1862 – 1926). This was the Fortnightly Poetry project for February 7th, 2010.
Fátimih Baraghání (1814/1817 – 1852), also known by the titles of Táhirih (Arabic for “The Pure One”) and Qurratu’l-‘Ayn (Arabic for “Consolation of the Eyes”) was an influential Iranian poet and Bábí heroine from the town of Qazvín. Her legacy is important to Bahá’ís, as well as supporters of women’s rights in Iran. In 1844, she became the seventeenth disciple or “Letter of the Living” of the Báb (1819-1850). As the only woman in this initial group of disciples, she is often compared to Mary Magdalene. From June-July 1848, she attended the Conference of Badasht where she appeared without a veil in public (a shocking statement of women’s rights) and declared that a new religious dispensation had been inaugurated. Coincidentally, shortly after this, the Seneca Falls Convention (an important women’s rights convention) was held in New York on the 19th-20th of July, 1848. She was executed in Tehran in 1852. Before her death, she said that although she would be killed, they could not stop the emancipation of women. Edward Granville Browne described her thus: “The appearance of such a woman as Qurratu’l-‘Ayn is in any country and any age a rare phenomenon, but in such a country as Persia it is a prodigy—nay, almost a miracle. Alike in virtue of her marvellous beauty, her rare intellectual gifts, her fervid eloquence her fearless devotion, and her glorious martyrdom, she stands forth incomparable and immortal amidst her countrywomen.” This poem is a ghazal composed in the Kámil metre. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. Browne notes that this poem appears to be addressed to the Báb. Browne made a versified translation of the poem, which first appeared in the J.R.A.S. in 1899.

So the next morning Nausicaa persuades her parents to lend her a wagon to take clothes down to the river for washing.<br /><br />The party goes down to the washing pool. Nausicaa is about to fold and put away the clothing when the ship-wrecked Odysseus, who is asleep nearby, wakes up. He wonders where he is.<br /><br />Grabbing an olive branch to hide his modesty, he walks out, caked in salt from the sea and looking terrible. The attendants run away at sight of him, but Nausicaa stands her ground. Odysseus thinks that she might be a goddess, perhaps Artemis. He then tells her that he has been at sea for 20 days, harassed by the god Poseidon, and only came on shore the previous day. He asks Nausicaa for some clothes and if she can tell him how he can get to town.<br /><br />Nausicaa says fate is in Zeus’ hands, but that since Odysseus has reached her country, and she is the daughter of the king, she won't let him go without clothes. She tells her attendants not to be afraid, and to wash the stranger in the river. They give him clothes and an oil flask. He asks them to go away so he can bathe.<br /><br /> Odysseus,washed and dressed, looks like a god. Nausicaa says she would like someone like him to be her husband.

He is to wait there until she gets back to the palace. Only then should he come out.

So the next morning Nausicaa persuades her parents to lend her a wagon to take clothes down to the river for washing.<br /><br />The party goes down to the washing pool. Nausicaa is about to fold and put away the clothing when the ship-wrecked Odysseus, who is asleep nearby, wakes up. He wonders where he is.<br /><br />Grabbing an olive branch to hide his modesty, he walks out, caked in salt from the sea and looking terrible. The attendants run away at sight of him, but Nausicaa stands her ground. Odysseus thinks that she might be a goddess, perhaps Artemis. He then tells her that he has been at sea for 20 days, harassed by the god Poseidon, and only came on shore the previous day. He asks Nausicaa for some clothes and if she can tell him how he can get to town.<br /><br />Nausicaa says fate is in Zeus’ hands, but that since Odysseus has reached her country, and she is the daughter of the king, she won't let him go without clothes. She tells her attendants not to be afraid, and to wash the stranger in the river. They give him clothes and an oil flask. He asks them to go away so he can bathe.<br /><br /> Odysseus,washed and dressed, looks like a god. Nausicaa says she would like someone like him to be her husband. She tells her attendants to give him food and drink.<br /><br />Then Nausicaa packs up the wagon and tells Odysseus to follow behind, but that, to prevent scandal,he must stop at a grove that is sacred to Athena. He is to wait there until she gets back to the palace. Only then should he come out. He should then enter the city, find the palace, and look for Nausicaa's mother because, if Nausicaa's mother takes to him, all will be well and he will be helped to go on his way home.<br /><br />They set off, and reach the sacred grove that evening.<br /><br />(Summary by hefyd)</p>

The answer: Down deep, they all seek something better. But will they find true fulfillment they are seeking?  The non-conformist, Manaheem, Herod's foster brother, is hired by Herod to foment an insurrection against Pontius Pilate, whom he distrusts. Manaheem recruits the blacksmith, Barabbas, to be the insurrection leader, to the dismay of Barabbas' Godly but fearful wife (when he finally tells her). The mendicant, an unfortunate but pensive young man named Timotheus, joins with an older beggar completely unsympathetic to his musings. Pontius Pilate sees himself as a weak ruler, but his wife pushes him to be stronger and to even take over Herod's territory.  Manaheem re-unites with his former wife, Claressa. In need of more money, he tries to blackmail Herod over his illicit affair With Herodius, his brother’s wife, but, Herod decides to marry Herodius and send his present wife back to her father.   John the Baptist preaches to Herod and looses his head.  Herod's palace is attacked, and suspecting Pilate, he tells Manaheem go ahead with the mission.   Barabbas is successful in forming a group of insurrectionists and they rehearse for the big day.  But will the insurrection succeed?    What is next, and how will Barabbas and Manaheem get the money the need?  More importantly, will all find the fulfillment they seek?  Listen to find out.

Both ladies connected when they discovered an equally relentless love for 80's slashers and Heather Langenkamp. It's one thing to love horror, but both Hannah and Ashlee took their fandom to academia through studying gender roles and the cultural influences behind their favorite genre films. 

But both ladies knew horror bled beyond the celluloid frame, and that through much research, women were sorely marginalized. It was time to join forces to launch the Women in Horror Month Podcast. 

With super-major-crazy amounts of excitement, the two have fused their morbid brains together to showcase the multitude of women artists in horror with a community interactive approach to interviews and discussions for the underrepresented female horror artist and those who support them.

However, there have been three notable exceptions to this convention; the French translation by J. B. Nicolas (1867), the English version by Justin Huntly McCarthy (1889) and another English version by Frederick Rolfe (better known as Baron Corvo, the author of Hadrian VII), published in 1903.

Charles Blanden (1857 - 1933) belonged to the group known as the Chicago poets, the most famous of which was Carl Sandburg. Unlike his celebrated contemporary. Blanden was no innovator, and most of his verse is sweet and melodious, composed with craftsmanlike skill, but often lacking in imaginative fervour. Most of his collections of verse, bearing such titles as The Battle of Love, A Chorus of Leaves, A Drift of Song, and A Valley Muse, were published in limited editions, which have not since been reprinted, and today his poetry is considered of little more than historical interest.

One of Blanden’s most engaging enterprises was his verse reworking of Justin McCarthy’s prose translation of the Rubaiyat, which was published in 1901. Blanden uses an eight line verse structure with a rhyming scheme of ABABCDCD. As he was working with images and arguments supplied by a poet far more eloquent than himself, Blanden was free to focus on the elegance and flow of the lines, and as a result, the work predominantly reflects his skill in versification, whch was considerable, rather than his own conceptions, which were often commonplace. 

It cannot be pretended that Blanden’s work compares in force and depth with the more celebrated versions of the Rubaiyat, such as those by Edward Fitzgerald and Edward Whinfield. However, listeners who surrender themselves to the elegant euphony of Blanden’s verses may still find themselves transported to the alluring world of the ancient Middle East.

In it Aristotle argues that the Earth is a sphere by pointing to the evidence of lunar eclipses. Aristotle also provides a detailed explanation of his theory of 'gravity' arguing that things which contain 'earth' fall towards the centre of the Universe because 'earth' is naturally attracted to the centre of the Universe. Aristotle argues that if the planet Earth was moved to the location of the Moon then objects which contain 'earth' would not fall towards the centre of the Earth but rather towards the centre of the Universe. Aristotle believed that the more 'earth' an object contained the faster it would fall. Aristotle argues that there is another type of matter called 'fire' which is naturally repelled from the centre of the Universe. In addition to his own theories Aristotle expounds the theories of the Pythagoreans (that the Earth is one of the stars and that numbers are the literal building blocks of our world) and Democritus (that matter is made of atoms and objects float because of the motions of these atoms).

Their story may appear to revolve around technology and engineering, but their impact goes much further, transforming lives for the better.<br/>In the words of one of the contributors, Ericsson has helped build “freedom for everybody”. By linking people and communities, markets and cultures, Ericsson has played a vital role in breaking down barriers, democratizing communications and supporting a basic human need to communicate.<br/>The story began 136 years ago, when Lars Magnus Ericsson built his first telephones and exchanges. Building on his legacy, Ericsson then went on to invent switching networks and complete cellular systems. It evolved via GSM and digital data, introduced 3G and innovated in LTE and beyond.<br/>At each step, Ericsson people have been united by a passionate, fearless belief that “anything and everything is possible”; always testing limits, putting their beliefs on the line, and asking “how far can you go?”<br/>On The Line is not about products or services. Instead it highlights Ericsson’s personality, its people’s values - and the moments where sparks of imagination and innovation changed everything. The name itself is intended to reflect the risk that Ericsson people were willing to take, and also the more literal interpretation of communicating by phone.<br/>Ericsson’s contemporary innovators are building a Networked Society, standing upon the shoulders of giants.<br/>This is their story.

The book’s full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It was controversial because it contradicted religious beliefs which underlay the then current theories of biology. Darwin’s book was the culmination of evidence he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and added to through continuing investigations and experiments since his return.

Richardson trans.), “On the Old Saw” (E.B. Ashton trans.), or “On the Common Saying” (both M.J. Gregor and H.B. Nisbet) – Kant takes up the issue of the relation of theory to practice in three distinct ways. In the first, he replies to Christian Garve’s criticism of his moral theory, in the second, he distances himself from Thomas Hobbes, and in the third, Moses Mendelssohn. The three taken together are representative of the breadth of Kant’s moral and political thought; the first section being concerned with the individual, the second with the state, and the third with the species. Although this is, on the whole, a difficult piece to approach, the second and third sections are often read as a way into Kant’s political thought, and serve this purpose well, especially when read alongside his Perpetual Peace.

A killer has come to town. The victims are connected; each pointing to the next, as if in answer to the question: Who is The One?

Is it Peter Reynolds: mild-mannered office clerk pouring petrol through his neighbour’s letterbox in the middle of the night?

Is it Wayne Dolan: a man whose sexual fantasies about his neighbour spiral into dangerous obsession when he learns of her secret life as a dominatrix?

Or is it Gaz: leader of three friends who love nothing more than sex, weed and partying? All women are easy prey for his charms. All except Sally. And the one who doesn’t want him, is the one he has to have – whether she likes it or not.

Mick Nixon has to find the connection, because people are disappearing - and if he and Sally are ever going to share more than just lunch, he’d better hurry up, or they could be next.

A dark, funny, and at times horrific ride, One Among the Sleepless is a thriller set just below the surface of suburban existence. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll throw it through your neighbour’s window tied to a house brick!

He attended UCLA, worked in corporate computer operations for a number of years before pursuing photography; graduating from Brooks Institute with a BA in commercial photography in 1985. Wilmott also owned and operated a very successful sports collectibles business for 10 years before deciding to pursue a career in law in 1998. Gary received his JD in 2002 and currently works for a firm in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilmott has been following the eligibility issue since the 2008 campaign and started his highly successful blog: giveusliberty1776.blogspot.com in June of 2009. A frequent caller and guest of talk radio; he has earned a reputation as a passionate and vocal proponent of the Constitution and a firm believer that Barack Obama’s illegal power grab threatens the security and freedom of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A founding member of the Article II Super Pac and the Article II Legal Defense Fund, Wilmott has devoted virtually all of his spare time to the eligibility issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilmott believes that the Article 2 Super PAC&apos;s goal in educating citizens and elected officials so that they clearly understand the definitive meaning of &quot;Natural Born Citizen&quot; is essential to the development of a legally-binding vetting process that will avoid future election fraud as it relates to the &quot;selection/election&quot; of our future presidents/commander-in-chiefs. Wilmott and Article 2 Super PAC welcome the opportunity to reach out to listeners on America’s Web Radio and spread the message of our Founding Fathers: freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all.&lt;/p&gt;"	One Nation Under Fraud

Mr. Black, Mr. White, and Mr. Blonde are the chosen pseudonyms for the three major players at Open Road Podcast. Mr. Black and Mr. White both work as consultants and contractors in the auto industry. 

In each podcast posted at this site, and also available through iTunes, the three discuss relevant issues of the day in the car business, from driving impressions of new products to commentary on future products to an exploration of the more fascinating technologies in the automotive field. The show is skewed towards car enthusiasts who seek an alternative to the consensus, watered-down views often expressed in more conventional outlets. 

Both Mr. Black and Mr. White have held a variety of marketing, communications, and product roles in the auto industry, mostly relating to the creation of sports cars and high-performance cars. Each has written white papers about future product, and some of those products are on sale in the US. 

From time to time, Open Road Podcast has well-informed guests, such as engineers and designers, to cover complex topics where an expert&apos;s views and knowledge are essential. 

For new visitors, it&apos;s important to note that our early podcasts were experimental and focused on auto shows. They often veered into some of the industry&apos;s more arcane corners and back alleyways. After this learning experience, Mr. Black and Mr. White agreed to shift to more specific commentary on new products. But come the show season, Mr. Black and Mr. White will once again deliver commentary on show properties. The scope of these podcasts will continue to expand. 

Because they have day jobs, the three will remain Mr. Black, Mr. White, and Mr. Blonde for a long time to come.

He was a modest and charming man, a graceful essayist, a sure critic. His contribution to American poetry is small but of fine quality. His best poems, such as ""The Venus of Milo,"" ""The Fool's Prayer"" and ""Opportunity,"" gave him a high place among the minor poets of America, which might have been higher but for his early death.

He grew a passion for dance music when he was young, always loved the feel of music with driving beats. Hailing from Jordan, his musical journey began during his childhood when he became fascinated by electronic dance music at an early age. He spent 3 years learning step by step how to produce music and also spent this time experimenting with different sounds until he found the one he was passionate about. In 2007 he decided that Trance was indeed his one true music love and it was then he focused on creating euphoric and uplifting Trance music encompassing elements of classical music, new age, chill out and Ambient.

As the years passed so has the quality of his music and indeed his international profile. His name is now synonymous with labels such as the massive “Armada Music” and current favorite Turkish label “Blue Soho Recordings”. It was on Blue Soho that his first top notch single “Only For You” was released with the “Arctic Moon Remix” topping radio shows &amp; download charts, gaining a massive amount of support from a high number of top DJs. 
The success of his productions lead to him receiving a lot of “Future Favorite” votes on the world’s top “A State Of Trance” by Armin van Buuren, and his recent single “Victory” was in list for the ASOT TOP 20 of 2013 voted by the listeners , considered one of the most melodic &amp; unique singles."

""The only possible excuse for this book is that it is an answer to a challenge. Even a bad shot is dignified when he accepts a duel.""  This is how Chesterton explains ""Orthodoxy,"" the sequel to Heretics.  ""I have attempted in a vague and personal way, in a set of mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions, to state the philosophy in which I have come to believe. I will not call it my philosophy; for I did not make it. God and humanity made it; and it made me.""

This is a book about Everything, about the reasons for the entire Universe and the existance of Humanity.  Andit's kinda funny. except for the serious parts and the sad parts.  It's about all of life, and human life includes humor, drama and sadness, so that's all in the book, too.  The chapters look longer than they are, each being roughly an hour -- and no, it wouldn't have worked to break them in half.  I've found them a very quick listen.

Hope you enjoy this book.  If you liked Heretics, you'll like Orthodoxy, because it's Chesterton.  And if you do, please share it, please comment about it, rate it, blog and podcast and Tweet about it.  Oh, and let me know.  :)

Publicada em 1572, é poema épico em dez cantos, narrando os feitos dos Portugueses em suas guerras e descobertas marítimas, em uma visão maravilhosa e exaltada, grandiosa e de comovente patriotismo. Apesar das barreiras que se põem ao leitor moderno, as referências mitológicas às vezes recônditas, as menções a episódios e personagens históricos menos conhecidos, a sua modernidade é surpreendente e a pessoa do poeta se impõe admirável, concreta e única em sua genialidade. A força da linguagem, a beleza dos seus versos, desafia qualquer comentário. (Summary by zaaf)Camões (1524-1580) is considered Portugal’s greatest poet, and Os Lusiadas, his masterpiece. Published in 1572, this epic poem in ten cantos sings of the deeds of the Portuguese in their warfare and overseas discoveries, in an exalted vision of wonder, grandiloquence and moving patriotism. Once the obvious obstacles to the modern reader are surmounted, such as arcane mythological references or mentions to lesser known historic passages and characters, the modernity of this work may be surprising, and the author’s persona emerges in his unique, concrete and admirable geniality. The strength of his diction and the beauty of his verses simply defy words. (Summary translated by Leni)	Camões (1524-1580) é o maior poeta da nossa língua, e Os Lusíadas a sua obra maior.

Brandeis harshly criticized investment bankers who controlled large amounts of money deposited in their banks by middle-class people. The heads of these banks, Brandeis pointed out, routinely sat on the boards of railroad companies and large industrial manufacturers of various products, and routinely directed the resources of their banks to promote the interests of their own companies.

Brandeis supported his contentions with a discussion of the actual dollar amounts -- in millions of dollars -- controlled by specific banks, industries, and industrialists such as J. P. Morgan, noting that these interests had recently acquired a far larger proportion of American wealth than corporate entities had ever had before. He extensively cited testimony from a Congressional investigation performed by the Pujo Committee, named after Louisiana Representative Arsène Pujo, into self-serving and monopolistic business dealing.

Audience members grab a drink, find a seat and watch the stories unfold. 

With no &#8220;fourth wall,&#8221; OUR BAR is often described as a month&#8217;s worth of bar antics artfully shoved into one hour, and like any great night out on the town, each show is unique.  The material you see at each OUR BAR lives and dies before your eyes.

The OUR BAR crew has offered up increasingly impressive shows every month since November 2009 thanks to the endless supply of stories from New York City&#8217;s ever amusing nightlife.  Somehow the block of wood that resides between bartender and customer gives strangers permission to open up in surprising and incredible ways.  It is this dynamic that is at the heart of every OUR BAR.  Blending New Yorkers&#8217; love of bar life, theater and tasty whiskeys, OUR BAR is carving out its own cult following.

These podcast episodes have been compiled from some of our favorite OUR BAR performances.

According to tradition, the monastery sits at the base of the mountain where Moses received the Tablets of the Law. Set in rugged country, accessible in times past only by a many days journey by camel across barren desert, the monastery survived intact through the centuries, and, as a result, became a rich repository of religious history—told through its icons, mosaics, and the books and manuscripts in the monastery library.<br/><br/>

Our Journey to Sinai by Agnes Bensly is the story of a visit to Saint Catherine's by a group of British scholars in the 1890's, who were drawn there in quest of manuscripts from early Christian times. The group had one particular prize in their sights. It was a second century translation of the Gospels from Greek into an Aramaic dialect called Syriac. This was a rare find indeed. One of the group, Agnes Smith Lewis, an accomplished linguist, had been to the monastery once before. On that visit, she had spotted a “palimpsest of most venerable appearance,” a palimpsest being a parchment (leather) paged book, which had been used to write on at two different times, the first set of writing having been partially scraped off the parchment before it was reused. Agnes Smith Lewis had recognized the hidden underwriting in this book to be in Syriac, “the native language of Our Lord and His disciples.” And now, the excited group had decided to revisit Saint Catherine's, in hopes of copying and reading the ancient text. Their trip is vividly described by Agnes Bensly --bustling Cairo; a tent and camel crossing of the desert with Bedouin guides; the monks and monastery life; a breathtaking climb up 3000 stone steps to the top of Mount Sinai, and what they found in the mysterious manuscript they had come so far to see.<br/><br/>

They live among us here in America. They also dwell in the countries far away across the wide ocean.

Why are they so scattered, you may ask. Is there no country which is really theirs, and which is ruled over by some one they have chosen? Is there not some place where they can gather together happily whenever they please? The answer is always no.

They cannot say of this land or of that, ""It is ours,"" for they are homeless. Palestine, which was once theirs, is now in the hands of the Turks. Jerusalem, the city they love best in the whole world, is in the power of those who look with scorn upon the Jewish people.

For many centuries they have been scattered far and wide. Their children learn to speak the language of the country where they happen to be born. They play the games and dress in the fashion of that country.

What is it that keeps them Jews? It is their religion, and their religion alone. It binds them as closely together now as it did in the days when they worshipped in the great temple at Jerusalem, two thousand years ago.

These Jewish cousins would say to us, ""Our people have suffered greatly. Yet they do not lose courage. Our parents tell us stories of the glorious past, over and over again. They will not let us forget it, and they teach us to hope for the time when Jerusalem will again be ours, and a new temple, in which we shall be free to worship, will stand upon the spot where the old one was destroyed.""

Est: October 2009

Born in Burnley, Lancashire

Horsey &amp; friends want to bring underground house &amp; techno to Burnley every 3/4 months, as cheap as possible for you guys.

Our Home: 

The BASSment @ Barcode, Hammerton Street, Burnley

Its the home of Our House. Been some special nights in the BASSment. Lets not kid ourselves. Its not got an extreme lighting system. Its not got props, backgrounds, table service or a VIP area. Theres 2 decks. A mixer. A soundsystem. A bar. Thats it. Stripped back to the raw elements, its all about the music. The dj HAS to pull it out of the bag here, theres no excuse. The music snobs of Burnley and beyond shall be watching and listening with a high level of anticipation....

Think of it as the DC10 of Burnley!

'House &amp; Techno - for those who appreciate it'.

Spicy romance writer Deborah Ochery brings you ""Adventures in Speed Dating."" Speed dating is where the best your city has to offer steps forth to WOW you in ninety seconds or less! Kendra is not impressed.

Janet Loftis brings you science fiction in ""The Human Jean Gnome Project, "" where a hospital laboratory, a dwarf, and a confused intern make beautiful puns together. In ""Yeah, But Can It Drive a Car"" aliens fly millions of miles just to navigate California freeways. This involves much driving like Starsky and Hutch, some general exasperation and the possibility of grisly death.

Xina Marie Uhl brings you fantasy in ""A Fairy Tail,"" where a lustful knight and a shape-changing unicorn compete to win the hand of a damsel who’s not in distress. In the super short story ""Out of the Bag"" Jason the cop expects a normal day on the force, but a chance encounter on a breaking and entering call changes everything. A bonus excerpt from The Cat’s Guide to Human Behavior gives you a hilarious taste of humans’ eccentricities from a cat’s point of view.

outlaw-of-torn-the-by-burroughs-edgar-rice	Outlaw of Torn, The by BURROUGHS, Edgar Rice		https://librivox.org/rss/3632	http://librivox.org/the-outlaw-of-torn-by-edgar-rice-burroughs/	LibriVox	info@librivox.org	""	""	false	"The story is set in 13th century England and concerns the fictitious outlaw Norman of Torn, who purportedly harried the country during the power struggle between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort. Norman is the supposed son of the Frenchman de Vac, once the king's fencing master, who has a grudge against his former employer and raises the boy to be a simple, brutal killing machine with a hatred of all things English. His intentions are partially subverted by a priest who befriends Norman and teaches him his letters and chivalry towards women.

Otherwise, all goes according to plan. By 17, Norman is the best swordsman in all of England; by the age of 18, he has a large bounty on his head, and by the age of 19, he leads the largest band of thieves in all of England. None can catch or best him. In his hatred for the king he even becomes involved in the civil war, which turns the tide in favor of de Montfort. In another guise, that of Roger de Conde, he becomes involved with de Montfort's daughter Bertrade, defending her against her and her father's enemies. She notes in him a curious resemblance to the king's son and heir Prince Edward.

Finally brought to bay in a confrontation with both King Henry and de Montfort, Norman is brought down by the treachery of de Vac, who appears to kill him, though at the cost of his own life. As de Vac dies, he reveals that Norman is in fact Richard, long-lost son of King Henry and Queen Eleanor and brother to Prince Edward. The fencing master had kidnapped the prince as a child to serve as the vehicle of his vengeance against the king. Luckily, Norman/Richard turns out not to be truly dead, surviving to be reconciled to his true father and attain the hand of Bertrade (Summary by Wikipedia)"	"The story is set in 13th century England and concerns the fictitious outlaw Norman of Torn, who purportedly harried the country during the power struggle between King Henry III and Simon de Montfort.

Sannokai underboss Kato warns Ikemoto about his overt dealings with family outsider Murase, an old-timer with whom he recently made a pact in prison. In an effort to ease Mr. Chairman’s suspicions, Ikemoto asks fellow boss Otomo to do his dirty work for him by making a minor but obvious move against Murase.
Otomo’s actions are the start of a ruthless series of conflicts and betrayals. Before long, several yakuza clans are out for blood in their constant battle for power and money. The rival bosses fight to rise through the ranks by scheming and making short-lived allegiances. In this corrupt world where there are no heroes, it's Bad Guy vs. Bad Guy in a spiraling outrage of gang warfare..."

His first published poetry was included in the Portsmouth Journal in 1837 but he drew more attention when, on September 13, 1838, he delivered his ""Anniversary Poem"" to the Boston Mercantile Library Association.

Genres: Lesbian, Romance, Fiction, BDSM, Erotica

When television commercial production coordinator Meg Curtis gets stood up by her longtime boyfriend, she vents her frustration by feverishly writing in a diary. At a time when she is unsure about all things romantic, she encounters 5th grade teacher Regina Baker at yoga class, a free-spirited single mom who is beautiful, playful, and impossibly intriguing. What starts as friendship turns sharply toward something more as they learn they each share a love for very dark and unconventional sensual expression. Despite significant differences in lifestyle, each woman is desperate to get close to the other to explore the depths of devotion. 
Shocked, yet thrilled by the intense level of Regina’s erotic desire, Meg turns apprehensive. She had never been with a woman— never had to be in society with a woman, never had to wonder what labels may be placed upon her relationship, never considered herself anything but obsessed with men. Regina, also enchanted by a woman for the first time, finds freedom from the pressures of daily life by committing herself to Meg. Compelled by the need for a balance between worlds, the two embark on a daring, passionately physical role-playing game. Welcoming Regina’s darkest needs, Meg explores her own deep-seated desires that have been locked away in the shadows her whole life.

Erotic, amusing, and profoundly romantic, Owning Regina is a tale that will awaken you, possess you, and transport you to an alternate universe that steams with passion and danger."	Diary of my unexpected passion for another woman
