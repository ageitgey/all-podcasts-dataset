Ratification of the Articles took place almost three and a half years later on March 1st, 1781. The purpose of the articles was to create a confederation of sovereign states with a weak central government; thus allowing state governments to wield most of the power. It wasn’t long before the need for a stronger federal government was realized which led to the Articles being replaced by the United States Constitution. The Articles of Confederation is the common term for The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.  The U.S. Constitution: The United States Constitution is the legal backbone of the United States of America and comprises the basic laws of the United States Federal Government. Delegates from twelve of the thirteen original colonies put the Constitution’s frame work together in May 1787 in Philadelphia. The Constitution defines the three branches of government and their jurisdictions; they are the Executive Branch (President/Vice President), Legislative Branch (Congress comprised of the Senate & House of Representatives), and the Judicial Branch (the Supreme Court). The need for three branches of government was to create a separation of powers so that not one person or group has full responsibilities, but that they’re spread out and each branch must refer to the other by a means of checks and balances. The Declaration of Independence: The Declaration of Independence is a document that is the epitome of freedom and liberty. It was drafted by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 as a list of grievances against the King of England, George III. The Declaration expresses the conviction of Americans in a philosophy of self-evident truths of what individual liberty and freedom should be. The Declaration was the beginning to separation from England and the catalyst for a birth of a nation. The Gettysburg Address: The Gettysburg Address is considered one of the greatest and most quoted speeches of a President throughout American history. President Abraham Lincoln gave his address on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19th, 1863. It was a few months after the battle at Gettysburg was over, the purpose of Lincoln being there was to consecrate a cemetery to the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. It is believed that Lincoln’s main goal of this opportunity was to fight for the United States as a united country and to express the equality of all under the law.

Rock scene survivor Mike Yusi. A mix of great rock music, album referrals and reviews, humor, and astute observations about our culture and times, UC Radio is the most accurate rebirth of the Southern California pirate radio community out there.

Enjoying total freedom of speech, content and format, Mike brings a certain So. Cal. flair to the show, playing the best music available from both indie and major labels, doing spotlight shows on major artists, all while educating the masses with his “This Day in Music History” segments in every show.  And if you’re lucky, you might catch Mike on a day when he’ll explain his physical reaction to Coldplay.

In the end, it’s all about the music, and Mike’s dedication to playing only tunes that he actually listens to himself keeps the show honest and entertaining.  And as Mike always says, Volume is Good, so Turn it Up!"	UC Radio is produced in the spirit of the Pirate Radio stations in Southern California in the late 70's &amp; 80's. Total freedom of choice on the music played, never the same old thing.

uit-het-avro-radiotheater	Uit het AVRO Radiotheater	""	http://download.omroep.nl/avro/podcast/radiotheater/radiotheater.xml	http://avro.nl/radiotheater/	""	""	""	""		"De AVRO presenteert Emma's Feest, het vijfde deel van de dramareeks Uit Het AVRO Radiotheater. In dit programma brengt de AVRO spraakmakende stukken van de planken naar de radio.
De acteurs van de toneelstukken voeren de stukken ook op in het radiotheater. 
Dit maal is het de beurt aan de tragikomedie Emma?s Feest van Flip Broekman. Hij schreef het stuk speciaal voor topacteurs Bram van der Vlugt en Ingeborg Elzevier die beiden voor het eerst in hun lange carrière gezamenlijk in een productie spelen. 

Een productie van Palentino Media.


Emma (Elzevier) is de huishoudster van de flamboyante oud-minister Van Kalsbeek (Van der Vlugt). Kalsbeek is wel to-do en een blaaskaak met een onfris verleden die graag opschept over zijn veroveringen. Emma is een eenvoudige vrouw die voldoening haalt uit haar werk en de zorg voor Maarten, haar idealistische maar luie kleinzoon. Geheel onverwacht zet Kalsbeek Emma na veertig jaar trouwe dienst aan de kant. Haar wereld stort in. Emma?s kleinzoon Maarten vindt belastend materiaal tegen de werkgever van zijn oma en chanteert hem hiermee om zo een waardig en groots afscheid  af te dwingen. 

Emma?s Feest gaat over dromers, oplichters en afpersers tegen wil en dank. 

Flip Broekman (1954) schrijft naast stukken voor toneel onder andere ook cabaret en liedteksten. ?Emma?s Feest? schreef hij speciaal voor de toneelkanonnen Elzevier en Van der Vlugt. Zij worden in dit stuk bijgestaan door Wouter de Jong die de rol van Maarten voor zijn rekening neemt. 

De regie van de radiobewerking is in de ervaren handen van Peter te Nuyl. Hij tekende ook voor de eerdere delen van Uit Het AVRO Radiotheater. Dit zijn onder andere ?De Kus? van Ger Thijs met in de hoofdrollen Carine Crutzen en Huub Stapel, een bewerking van het toneelstuk ?237 Redenen Voor Seks? met Leopold Witte en Geert Lageveen en de stukken ?Boiling Frog?, ?Het Uur Van Het Konijn? en ?Op De Ziel? Ander bekend werk van Peter te Nuyl zijn de radiodramaseries Bommel en Het Bureau."	Emma's Feest

Featuring some of Miami's finest musical talents, this album elevates the familiar sounds of today's mainstream latin music to a new level.  In songs like &quot;Que Se Sentira&quot; (What does it feel) a beatleish styled ballad produced alongside well re-known latin producer and artist *MonteRosa*, you will undoubtely connect with the nostalgic behind many of Ulises Caloz's songs. &quot;Te Estoy Rogando &quot; (I Am Begging You), an uptempo track that dweels on the desperation for forgiveness of a man's human imperfections which has cost him the love of his life.   With his independent release of &quot;9 years&quot;, Ulises celebrates the latin pop/rock music that has influenced him since his early years growing up in his natal Cali, Colombia and pays tribute to all those who with hard-work and perseverence are able to bring to an audience the magic of their craft.

Sometimes it was blazing, brilliant and hot. Other times it was oddly dim, cool, shedding little warmth on its many planets. Gresth Gkae, leader of the Mirans, was seeking a better star, one to which his ""people"" could migrate. That star had to be steady, reliable, with a good planetary system. And in his astronomical searching, he found Sol.

With hundreds of ships, each larger than whole Terrestrial spaceports, and traveling faster than the speed of light, the Mirans set out to move in to Solar regions and take over.

And on Earth there was nothing which would be capable of beating off this incredible armada—until Buck Kendall stumbled upon THE ULTIMATE WEAPON.

(Introduction by John W. Campbell)"	"The star Mira was unpredictably variable. Sometimes it was blazing, brilliant and hot. Other times it was oddly dim, cool, shedding little warmth on its many planets. Gresth Gkae, leader of the Mirans, was seeking a better star, one to which his ""people"" could migrate. That star had to be steady, reliable, with a good planetary system. And in his astronomical searching, he found Sol.

With hundreds of ships, each larger than whole Terrestrial spaceports, and traveling faster than the speed of light, the Mirans set out to move in to Solar regions and take over.

And on Earth there was nothing which would be capable of beating off this incredible armada—until Buck Kendall stumbled upon THE ULTIMATE WEAPON.

Com preguiça, falta de preparação e sempre aguardando um melhor momento, mas agora vai!
Foi só dar um primeiro passo e os outros foram vindo automaticamente. As coisas acontecem no momento certinho.
A intenção desse projeto é ajudar, é mostrar a simplicidade nas buscas. É um livro que conta desde o meu começo com a experiência fora do corpo até hoje onde ainda há tanto que aprender .
Talvez seja útil para outros projetores e buscadores de assuntos espirituais, onde poderão encontrar  informações simples, as quais acontecem sempre com todos nós, em todos os lugares do mundo.
Recebi propostas de  editoras, algumas até conhecidas. Mas eu não poderia, caso aceitasse, disponibilizar mais o projeto no site gratuitamente.  Não tenho nada contra qualquer trabalho ser cobrado,  mas, a idéia do IVA sempre foi levar informações a todos de forma gratuita… Portanto  segue a minha caminhada aqui no nosso cantinho mesmo.
Enfim, segue abaixo o livro que vem em PDF e em áudio. Gravei em áudio também para ajudar àqueles que tem dificuldades visuais ou sintam mais facilidade ouvindo, além do que  tem sido uma característica do nosso trabalho.
Muita paz a todos.
Do amigo,

Written in 1952, the novel instantly rose to fame and split Americans up and down the country. Stowe was a passionate abolitionist and was inspired to write Uncle Tom when she spent time in Cincinnati in the early part of the 18th century. She met many slaves who had escaped from Kentucky and was touched by the friendships she built. It was with this sentiment that the novel was born and the deep empathy Stowe had for slaves is evident throughout.

As you would expect, the book was hugely provocative with pro-slavery supporters outraged by the negative portrayal of masters within the slave trade. It was said to be so incendiary that Abraham Lincoln claimed Stowe to be ""the little lady who started this great war"". It is not clear if that quote is genuine but the hype Stowe created both before and after the civil war is definitely real. The novel follows the story of long suffering slave Tom and mother and son duo Eliza and Harry. Whilst Tom is sold down the river by his master, Eliza and her son manage to escape the clutches of slavery.

There is no doubt in the genuineness of Howe’s wish to uncover the slave trade for all of its sins.  Pleasingly the book ends with an optimistic outlook, one that shook the government at the time and one sure to shake you."

In 1859 Dickens founded a new journal called All the Year Round and the Uncommercial Traveller articles would be among his main contributions. He seems to have chosen the title and persona of the Uncommercial Traveller as a result of a speech he gave on the 22 December 1859 to the Commercial Travellers' School London in his role as honorary chairman and treasurer. The persona sits well with a writer who liked to travel, not only as a tourist, but also to research and report what he found; visiting Europe, America and giving book readings throughout Britain. He does not seem content to rest late in his career when he had attained wealth and comfort and continued travelling locally, walking the streets of London in the mould of the flâneur, a 'gentleman stroller of city streets'. He often suffered from insomnia and his night-time wanderings gave him an insight into some of the hidden aspects of Victorian London, details of which he also incorporated into his novels.

He writes far into early mornings, after his wearying hours of scrubbing toilets and sweeping floors. He loves writing that much. 

But it's not only the joy of words that keeps him grinding; it's his desire to retire the janitor's mop. He sees being published as the key to living an improved life. James has another deep-seated conviction: that he's not good enough. He secretly longs to be accepted. However, the conventional others in his life seem all too willing to remind him that he's wasting his time.

Then he meets and falls in love with Leigh, the one bright spot in his endless misery of self-doubt. A quiet but resolutely religious girl, she has to fight off disapproval of her own from overly critical parents, whose insults are countered by James's often-voiced admiration of her. Likewise, Leigh's faith in his talents begins to build his confidence, eventually allowing her to introduce him to a different way to help himself: relying on God.

Ultimately, James's newfound faith is sorely tested to the point of doubt when his dream to be published seems to melt into a mirage, smothered by countless rejection slips from agents and publishers. His faith is also battered by having to fight highly emotional battles and suffer fear and loss. Just when James appears hopelessly sapped by devastating events, one last door opens, and he's rocked by an epiphany.

UNCONVENTIONAL is designed to inspire readers to reach for their dreams. Buy this book. Read it. Share it with everyone you know. You—and they—will be glad you did!

America had made a bad investment in sub-prime mortgages, and I had made a bad investment in sub-prime musical talent.  Needless to say, the combination of these two bad investments forced me to take a cold critical look at my relationship with rock and roll, and it&apos;s negative effect on my finances. After much rumination, it became quite apparent that I needed to stop focussing on music, and get a real job. I looked around a bit, and found all the real jobs were either taken or had been cut back due to the recession.  So I got me a bunch of &quot;not so real&quot; jobs in an effort to cobble together some semblance of a living...<br /><br />

... As much as I have tried to focus exclusively on these &quot;not so real&quot; jobs, I have been unable to kick my song making habit, and Under the Table Tennis (UTTT) is the ultimate result. I wrote and recorded these songs before, after, between, and often-times during my hours at work. As a group, the songs on UTTT embody the confusion, anger, and absurd resignation that becomes manifest when unbridled creative energy is continually reigned in by the ugly truth of economics. These songs are dedicated to anybody who has ever gone to their job thinking, &quot;I could do better.&quot; To anybody who has ever looked at their paycheck and thought, &quot;That's it?.&quot; To anybody who has ever been laid-off and wished they had said, &quot;You can't fire me, mother-fucker, I quit.&quot; To anybody who has ever been forced to ignore a heart beat to make ends meet, Under the Table Tennis is for you."

The novel takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Geneva, Switzerland, and is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Crime and Punishment, Conrad being reputed to have detested Dostoevsky.  It is also, some say, Conrad's response to his own early life; his father was a famous revolutionary imprisoned by the Russians, but, instead of following in his father's footsteps, at the age of sixteen Conrad left his native land forever....This novel is considered to be one of Conrad's major works and is close in subject matter to The Secret Agent. It is full of cynicism and conflict about the historical failures of revolutionary movements and ideals. Conrad remarks in this book, as well as others, on the irrationality of life, the opacity of character, the unfairness with which suffering is inflicted upon the innocent and poor, and the careless disregard for the lives of those with whom we share existence. - Summary by Wikipedia<p>	Under Western Eyes (1911) is a novel by Joseph Conrad.

""Dear Sir:—For most of the years I have lived, the escape of fugitives from slavery, and their efforts to baffle the human and other bloodhounds who tracked them, formed the romance of American History. That romance is now ended, and our grandchildren will hardly believe its leading incidents except on irresistible testimony. I rejoice that you are collecting and presenting that testimony, and heartily wish you a great success."" Horace Greeley.<br><br>
William Still is often called the Father of the Underground Railroad. Over 14 years, he helped hundreds of slaves escape to freedom in Canada. Still was committed to preserving the stories of the bondmen and he kept careful records of the many escaped slaves who passed through the Philadelphia “station”. The Underground Railroad was published in 1871 from Still’s records and diaries. In bringing you these stories, Librivox volunteers are reading from the 1878 edition. (Summary by MaryAnn)

Thrilling incidents, heroic adventures and noble deeds of self-sacrifice light up every page, and will enlist the heartiest sympathies of all generous souls. It was eminently just that such a record of one of the most remarkable phases of the struggle against slavery should be prepared, that the memory of the noble originators and supporters of the railroad might be kept green, and posterity enabled to form a true conception of the necessity that called it into existence, and of the difficulties under which its work was performed. The labor of compiling could not have fallen into more appropriate or better qualified hands."" The Philadelphia Inquirer  <br><br>William Still is often called the Father of the Underground Railroad.  Over 14 years, he helped hundreds of slaves escape to freedom in Canada.  Still was committed to preserving the stories of the bondmen and he kept careful records of the many escaped slaves who passed through the Philadelphia “station”.  The Underground Railroad was published in 1871 from Still’s records and diaries.  In bringing you these stories, Librivox volunteers are reading from the 1878 edition. (Summary by MaryAnn)

Here we have in complete detail the various methods adopted for circumventing the enemies of freedom, and told, as it is, with great simplicity and natural feeling, the narrative is one which cannot but make a deep impression. Thrilling incidents, heroic adventures and noble deeds of self-sacrifice light up every page, and will enlist the heartiest sympathies of all generous souls.

But when you're a member of the Flinch family, normal has never been easy.

For hundreds of years, the eldest male Flinch has been servant and guardian to the vampire, Lord Underwood. While the Flinches have changed through the generations, Underwood has remained eternal. David had hoped to be spared the horror of serving his family's lord and master, but when he is summoned to the Flinch home in Spain by his dying older brother, he knows his luck has run out. After fifty years of slumber, Underwood is to be resurrected from the grave in a ritual of human sacrifice, and David, by right of succession, is to be his resurrector. But there is another Flinch, one who craves the role of guardian to the vampire: David’s sister, Lydia. It’s a job she means to have, even if it means making David’s the first blood shed in this new age of Underwood and Flinch."	"All David Flinch ever wanted was a normal life.

The principal teacher is Ken McLeod, translator, author, and executive director of Unfettered Mind. Ken began his training in 1970 with the Tibetan master, the Ven. Kalu Rinpoche. Trained in the Kagyu, Shangpa, and Nyingma traditions of Buddhism in Tibet, he is known for his ability to explain difficult and subtle teachings and how ""he distills the nature and purpose of Buddhism to make it accessible for any newcomer without dumbing it down."" (PhilCatalfo, Yoga Journal, July 2001). His book, Wake Up to Your Life (published in 2001), provides a comprehensive and accessible approach to practice, from the initial stages of meditation up to the full integration of open awareness into one’s life. The recordings here are a selection of his teaching and retreats over the last several years and cover a wide range of topics: meditation, compassion, emptiness, power, conflict, and presence. Ken’s approach, and the approach at Unfettered Mind, is to create environments of awareness, conditions in which people experience directly what it means to be awake and present in life. His teachings include applications of Buddhist methods to the practicalities of life."	Unfettered Mind is a network of teachers and students. . .

That's what Lieutenant Terry Metcalfe keeps telling his friends and co-workers. A hero to the public, just months ago he successfully prevented the veritable destruction of human civilization at the hands of terrorists from the warlike Qraitian Empire. But Metcalfe has changed, grown unhappy with his role as an officer in the Confederate Navy. Distancing himself from his friends, he's decided to join a religious sect which believes it's literally found God living beneath the surface of the far-off planet Eleusis. And to be sure, there's something there: an alien intelligence which reaches out to the young Lieutenant and offers him the power to protect everything he loves. But is Metcalfe finding the spiritual fulfilment he's sought so long, or is he falling under the spell of a malevolent new enemy? 

Steven H. Wilson's original science fiction audio series, The Arbiter Chronicles, has captured the imaginations of audiences for over a decade. Winner of the Mark Time Silver Award and the Parsec Award for Best Speculative Fiction Audio Drama, it's character-driven space opera in the tradition of Heinlein's The Rolling Stones and Joss Whedon's Firefly. Drenched in adventure, humor and sexuality, Unfriendly Persuasion joins its predecessor, Taken Liberty, in bringing new depth to the popular audio drama series."

After individual notable paths filled with rewarding performances in the greatest clubs in the north of the country, Dj Emidio Meireles and Dj Mr. Moon now launch themselves in a Project that will bring the public all the fun, animation, diversion and amusement it searches for. Night will never be the same... The mixture of musical styles and sounds give this duo a show filled with emotion and nice musical taste. The performances in great clubs, as in the most important academic parties of the region give them a great acquaintance of the public, allowing the USB to shape the show that will be remembered for its irreverence and good mood. Their merit and recognition is noticeable by their performances in clubs like Teatro Circo Cafe, Vaticano, Cafe del Rio and Pedra do Couto. The USB leave behind performances in clubs like Industria, Bazaar, Sardinha Biba, Club Café Delmar, Seculo XIX, Cafe del Rio, Club Mau Mau, Maria PT, Katedral, Pacha de Ofir, Madilom, In Club,Club 0 no São Mamede, Zeitgueist Caffe, REDFLOOR (Suiça) among many others. They also work with importants groups like R_U_READY, BINTE30, GRUPO SÉCULO XIX.&lt;br /&gt;
USB influences go from the jazz to the soul, disco, funk, tech house vibes, giving them the needed features for the night to be successful, funny and really crazy!! In the future, this duo wants to star their project in organizing and producing events in the areas of music, fashion and design.&lt;br /&gt;

Ratification of the Articles took place almost three and a half years later on March 1st, 1781. The purpose of the articles was to create a confederation of sovereign states with a weak central government; thus allowing state governments to wield most of the power. It wasn’t long before the need for a stronger federal government was realized which led to the Articles being replaced by the United States Constitution. The Articles of Confederation is the common term for The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. </p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution: The United States Constitution is the legal backbone of the United States of America and comprises the basic laws of the United States Federal Government. Delegates from twelve of the thirteen original colonies put the Constitution’s frame work together in May 1787 in Philadelphia. The Constitution defines the three branches of government and their jurisdictions; they are the Executive Branch (President/Vice President), Legislative Branch (Congress comprised of the Senate & House of Representatives), and the Judicial Branch (the Supreme Court). The need for three branches of government was to create a separation of powers so that not one person or group has full responsibilities, but that they’re spread out and each branch must refer to the other by a means of checks and balances.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence: The Declaration of Independence is a document that is the epitome of freedom and liberty. It was drafted by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 as a list of grievances against the King of England, George III. The Declaration expresses the conviction of Americans in a philosophy of self-evident truths of what individual liberty and freedom should be. The Declaration was the beginning to separation from England and the catalyst for a birth of a nation.</p>
<p>The Gettysburg Address: The Gettysburg Address is considered one of the greatest and most quoted speeches of a President throughout American history. President Abraham Lincoln gave his address on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19th, 1863. It was a few months after the battle at Gettysburg was over, the purpose of Lincoln being there was to consecrate a cemetery to the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. It is believed that Lincoln’s main goal of this opportunity was to fight for the United States as a united country and to express the equality of all under the law. (Summaries by Aldark)

And it requires people to renounce ancient superstitions, to abandon the dead letter in order to be penetrated by the living and vivifying spirit, then by that very means it confirms the original purity of their religion, whilst helping them to know and love everything profoundly beautiful in the others… it will suffice for me to indicate that the Bahais believe that from all eternity God has raised up among human creatures higher beings who have inculcated mankind with the great moral principles on which societies are founded, and have thus been the supreme guides of its evolution.”

Hippolyte Dreyfus earned his doctorate in law in February 1898 and became the first French Bahá’í in 1901. In 1903 he gave up his legal career to devote himself to oriental studies. He enrolled at the École pratique des hautes études university in Paris, where he studied Arabic and Persian to be able to translate the Bahá’í writings into French. He was one of the only Western Bahá’ís of his generation to received such formal training. He was the author of numerous books, articles and translations of the Bahá’í faith. Dreyfus-Barney attained in September 1902 with an American Bahá’í, Lua Getsinger, an audience with Muzaffaru’d-Din Shah in Paris. During this meeting the Shah was personally handed a petition to protect their co-religionists in Iran. After his marriage (1911) with the American Bahá’í Laura Clifford Barney, he adopted the name Dreyfus-Barney. He also traveled to numerous countries and represented the Bahá’ís in legal disputes. He died on 20 December 1928 and was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. He was posthumously appointed by Shoghi Effendi as one of the 19 Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Please note that the term Bahaism is no longer used by Bahá’ís. The appropriate term is the Bahá’í Faith.

As a Faculty of the University of Alberta, Augustana continues to build on its reputation for high-quality teaching in a friendly, caring, residence-based setting. In doing so, it provides a distinctive small-campus undergraduate experience within one of Canada’s leading universities. Augustana remains mindful of its heritage, open to a diversity of perspectives and backgrounds, and responsive to the rural region in which it is located.

Augustana Faculty is characterized by a lively, collegial academic culture of research, creativity, and public engagement in which students are invited to participate. It values interdisciplinary inquiry, teaching, and learning. Augustana offers the opportunity of a memorable, life-changing education through small classes, personal attention from professors, a challenging, innovative curriculum founded on the liberal arts and sciences, experiential learning in wilderness and international environments, and a range of campus-life programs. In this academic community, students are more than narrow specialists, spectators, or strangers.

Augustana aspires to educate the whole person in an intimate, small-campus setting so that students and mentors alike are capable of engaging life with intellectual confidence and imaginative insight, equipped for leadership and service, and committed to the betterment of their world."	Augustana remains inspired by the convictions of our pioneer legacy. We are a place where students matter, where teaching is regarded a vocation, where community is an everyday experience.

Yes, I did invent a word (or two) there... It's a mash-up of Culture, Entertainment and Mindfulness coz we'll &quot;unleash&quot; each one of those beauties every fortnight. Ah yeah!

Each show, I'll chose a topic or two to unleash and match it with some good music to boot. 

With segments including &quot;Bucket List London&quot; (fun things we all should do each week), &quot;Quote of the Week&quot; (because we all need a little inspiration sometimes) and maybe even a cheeky chat with my Dad, former 70s DJ, &quot;Master Groove&quot;  with his opinions and a song choice or two.

So let's have a giggle, have a boogie and maybe 'do some learning' along the way!

Radio E_Rock! present to you the all new UNNAMED RADIO | www.unnamedradio.com

UNNAMED MORNING SHOW was officially established on September 2, 2008, when KCRH 89.9 FM and www.kcrhradio.com broadcasted a new nameless morning show at 7AM on a Tuesday; consisting of 6 college students from entirely different backgrounds and minimal radio experience. 

Soon after, the cast of characters settled and received rave reviews and ratings from the Chabot College Community and quickly became re-established and well known as the infamous, UNNAMED MORNING SHOW. 

Full of eclectic, creative, eccentric, and dynamic characters, the UNNAMED MORNING SHOW will go down in history as the most entertaining, controversial, and informative morning shows to ever broadcast in the East Bay Area. The formula which consists of new music, entertainment news, local artist showcases, underground shows, humorous personal story telling, live mixes, and entertaining interviews has allowed KCRH to reach outside the college community and gain an entirely new audience never possible before. Listeners from Castro Valley, Livermore, Modesto, Los Angeles, Michigan, and Florida are among the dedicated fans that interact with the UNNAMED MORNING SHOW by live calls, e-mails, etc. 

Towards the end of the UNNAMED MORNING SHOW’s FM life cycle the 2 hosts (Radio E_Rock! & Sir Butters) and producer (Alex Mac) decided that they had accomplished all that was possible for an East Bay Area Radio program. The decision came on May 7, 2009 to move the show more to the Internet where the potential audience is much greater. A final broadcast of the show aired on May 21, 2009 at 7AM on KCRH 89.9 FM. 

During a brief summer vacation from broadcasting the co-host, Sir Butters decided that the lifestyle of a radio personality on a highly rated show was not in his best interests and unexpectedly left the UNNAMED MORNING SHOW. At this point remaining host, E_Rock! and producer Alex Mac returned to KCRH 89.9 FM to rebuild and reestablish a morning show that would be accepted by a larger audience than before. After months of low ratings, the show started to see positive growth after the introduction of a new co-host, DJ Razberry of Rich Kid Academy. UNNAMED MORNING SHOW is currently off-air, but traffic to the shows past podcasts remains at an all time high. Radio E_Rock! also operates a website for the show radio program @ www.unnamedradio.com.

On his first day at Turner King, David Stewart quickly realizes that the world of international PR (affectionately, perhaps ironically, known as ""the dark side"") is a far cry from his previous job on Parliament Hill. For one, he missed the office memo on the all-black dress code; for another, there are enough acronyms and jargon to make his head spin. Before he even has time to find the washroom, David is assigned a major project: devise a campaign to revitalize North America's interest in the space program - maybe even show NASA's pollsters that watching a shuttle launch is more appealing than going out for lunch with friends. The pressure is on, and before long, David finds himself suggesting the most out-of-this-world idea imaginable: a Citizen Astronaut lottery that would send one Canadian and one American to the International Space Station. Suddenly, David's vaulted into an odyssey of his own, navigating the corporate politics of a big PR agency; wading through the murky but always hilarious waters of Canada-U.S. relations; and trying to hold on to his new job while still doing the right thing."

Washington detailing his slow and steady rise from a slave child during the Civil War, to the difficulties and obstacles he overcame to get an education at the new Hampton University, to his work establishing vocational schools—most notably the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama—to help black people and other disadvantaged minorities learn useful, marketable skills and work to pull themselves, as a race, up by the bootstraps. He reflects on the generosity of both teachers and philanthropists who helped in educating blacks and native Americans.

How does a virtually unknown Albertan group reach number one on Chart Attack's top 10 hip hop albums? 

The answer is by making incredible music, something recognized by campus radio stations across Canada as Touch and Nato's &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; snuck into the number one spot this past summer, topping efforts by well-known artists like Dizzee Rascal, Moka Only and Madlib.

Their hilarious video for &quot;Adult's Story&quot;, a Slick Rick-meets-Maury Povich riot has already received thousands of plays on popular sites like YouTube. A growing list of positive album reviews include respected websites like HipHopCanada, Urbnet and CDBaby. They've even been played on CBC Radio 3's popular podcast, with good friend Cadence Weapon singing their praises.

So, just who are these guys?

&quot;From the land of the pickup truck and black rubber puck&quot; (also known as Edmonton, Alberta) comes Touch, an aggressive, passionate emcee with swagger to spare, and Nato, one of the nation's best kept secrets at making beats and manning the turntables.

This country uses gold for chamber pots and prison chains, pearls and diamonds for children’s playthings, and requires that a man and a woman see each other exactly as they are, naked, before getting married. This book gave the word ‘utopia’ the meaning of a perfect society, while the Greek word actually means ‘no place’. Enjoy listening to this story about a country that really is too good to be true. (Summary by Jenilee.)	This book is all about the fictional country called Utopia. It is a country with an ‘ideal’ form of communism, in which everything really does belong to everybody, everyone does the work they want to, and everyone is alright with that...

Nastala je leta 1988, kot redni tedenski pregled notranjepolitičnih, gospodarskih, družbenih in kulturnih dogodkov v državi, ki je bila takrat še Jugoslavija. V oddajo so si utirala pot alternativna politična razmišljanja, informacije in slikovni materiali, ki v drugih oddajah takratnega Informativnega programa še niso uspeli ugledati luči sveta. UTRIP, ki je zdaj že polnoleten, si je postopno izboril prostor izrazito avtorske oddaje in subjektivnega pogleda na najpomembnejše dogodke minulega tedna.
