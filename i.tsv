Ogni puntata, una storia per cercare di realizzare una “fotografia” dei sognatori di oggi: ritratti di scrittori, professori, musicisti, dirigenti, missionari, volontari, amministratori, migranti… o semplici sognatori.
Racconti di scelte fatte da chi ama l’Italia, l’Africa e il mondo, anche quando le cose non vanno come vorrebbe. Racconti di chi, con la voglia di non arrendersi e con la capacità di guardare avanti, fa sperare in un futuro migliore.
Uno sguardo curioso e aperto, al di là di preconcetti e luoghi comuni.
Un programma di Silvio Ferremi, giornalista ed educatore professionale."	""

Part talk show, part performance art piece, part field recordings, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going to Kill You,&#8221; are the bi-monthly musings of two best friends of 17 years. No topic is off limits (Politics, Sex, Aztecs, She-Ra, Pete Burns, etc), but all are bound by the glamour and insanity that is IGTKY.

These best friends of 17 years originally from Cleveland have since relocated to the east coast; one living in Philadelphia and the other from New York City they call each other and their friends to discuss their insanity, glamour, Aztecs, She-Ra, Pete Burns, etc.

Launched in 2007, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going To Kill You,&#8221; quickly gained a cult following, entering into the top 10 comedy podcasts on Podomatic.com. Now with 10,000 regular listeners and over 250,000 iTunes downloads, &#8220;I&#8217;m Going To Kill You&#8221; is set to takeover the world! Well, perhaps not, but it will continue on with extreme glamour."	Two homosexuals live their lives like a runaway train:  out of control and loose in the caboose!

Sean works as a Quality Director, where he has ample opportunity to sharpen his smart-ass skills and imagine life as a high-ranking Libertarian politician.

Beth and Sean first started foisting their opinions on the unsuspecting public with &quot;The Go Dark Podcast&quot; in 2010, which focuses on their favorite hobby, paranormal investigation. In spite of this vast experience, they are not highly-trained podcast professionals, nor do they claim any expertise in the things they talk about.

Ehhez viszont vissza kell menni az időbe, méghozzá körülbelül 2004 elejére. Ekkoriban friss egyetemistaként, és linux mániákusként éltem fiatalos életemet. Mint Macintosh-t ismertem a platformot, de mint sokan, csak egy elszigetelt, és mindennel szemben álló dologként kezeltem. Anno devilkénél lógtam sokat, és ott persze lehetett fogni a Fix.Tv adásait. Így csöppentem bele az első I+ adásba. Innen vette pedig Macintosh korszakom kezdetét. Az adások nagyon emberközeliek, kicsit gagyik, de igazi szenvedélyes, vitázós, egymást lehülyézős stílusban folytak. Amik viszont nekem nagyon tetszettek, mert a sablonos unalmas technikai, semmit nem érő adásokból elegem volt már.  Mondhatni egyre függőbb lettem az adástól, mert maga a Macintosh világa is egyre jobban kezdett magával ragadni. Ismerőseim szerintem tudnának nyilatkozni, akkoriban szépen betáraztam minden estére egy-egy részt, majd meséltem mindenkinek az “élményeket”. :)  Hajdanán nagyon sok kri	Xorp Blog Podcast

On the surface, they look like typical men in their forties, with careers, families and responsibilities. But as with most people, there is more to them than meets the eye.

As the week progresses, they go down the rabbit hole of excess: mountains of drugs are consumed to a blaring rock 'n' roll soundtrack, parties with much younger women spin out of control. Exhausted and run ragged, they bare their souls and their reunion takes a much darker turn. When a promise from their past is brought to light, none of their lives will ever be the same. From director Mark Pellington, I MELT WITH YOU is a visually dazzling, wild and woolly trip deep into the male psyche, driven by four amazingly committed and profound performances from Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe and Christian McKay."

Take a rollicking ride through the 1970s with the original Moon Man, Barry McArdle, a silver-suited street performer and comic philosopher who spent ten years crisscrossing America selling lunar real estate (transportation not provided). As told by the author,  I Sold the Moon! explores how a young man, fresh out of college, could get the idea that he could claim the moon, and then sell it.  Exactly what drugs was he on?   Well??..

Moon Man's adventures are paralleled throughout by a more earthly concern: his romance with a young woman as adventurous as he, in the turbulent days of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.   The story of this ""first love"" is threaded from the opening chapter until the final page.  I Sold The Moon! is for anyone who believes in following their dreams and searching for true love.  It's cosmic, perceptive, passionate and fun.  Mostly fun.  Hear it here from the one, the only, the original Moon Man."	"Just because it happened, doesn't mean you'll believe it.

The show was based on the book by Matt Cvetic and purportedly told of his adventures as an undercover operative who joined the Communist Party to spy from within for the FBI. Many of the stories contained double-edged conflicts: Cvetic constantly looked for information, walking a tightrope among suspicious Party officials while unable to reveal his true mission even to his family. Dana Andrews stared as Matthew Cvetic, always closing with these words: ""I was a Communist for the FBI. I walk alone.""

DER REGISSEUR KOMMT AN BORD
Regisseur D.J. Caruso (EAGLE EYE, „Eagle Eye – Außer Kontrolle“, 2008, DISTURBIA, „Disturbia“, 2007) kann auf eine langjährige Geschäftsbeziehung mit Steven Spielberg und DreamWorks zurückblicken. Deshalb war er hocherfreut, die Regie von ICH BIN NUMMER VIER zu übernehmen.
„Meine Zusammenarbeit mit DreamWorks begann, als ich eine Fernsehserie mit dem Titel ‚High Incident‘ drehte“, erklärt Caruso. „Jahre später kamen wir bei DISTURBIA erneut zusammen, und dann folgte EAGLE EYE, eine weitere erfolgreiche Zusammenarbeit. Ich fühle mich als Teil der DreamWorks-Familie, und für mich als Filmemacher wurde die Firma zu einer zweiten Heimat.“

John Smith will eigentlich ein ganz normaler Teenager sein, aber die Tatsache, dass er auf der Flucht vor seinen Feinden von Stadt zu Stadt ziehen muss und über übermenschliche Fähigkeiten verfügt, macht ihn alles andere als normal.
John (Nummer Vier) flieht vor gnadenlosen Gegnern, die ausgeschickt wurden, um ihn zu vernichten. Deshalb ändert er permanent seine Identität und zieht gemeinsam mit seinem Beschützer Henri immer wieder um. Überall ist er „der Neue“, ohne jegliche Verbindung zu seiner Vergangenheit. In der kleinen Stadt Paradise, die er mittlerweile sein Zuhause nennt, begegnet er Sarah und beide schließen eine bedeutsame Freundschaft. Alles deutet darauf hin, dass John nun endlich doch ein normales Leben beginnen kann. Doch unerwartete, das Leben verändernde Dinge passieren: John bekommt übermenschliche Kräfte, die mogadorischen Feinde kommen immer näher und er erfährt alles über sein Schicksal. Die Zeit läuft ab für John – drei sind bereits tot und er ist Nummer Vier.

A group of engineers lead by John McVey, Craig Osborn, Gail Trabor, Andrew Dee and Jennifer McGee, occupy the largest space station every built to plan the future of the tiny colony. Sent there by Kennedy Lacombe, the richest man in the world, their only task is to find ways to mine the asteroid as efficiently as possible. John, however, has grandiose plans including riding a comet around the sun to obtain enough water for the colony to one day survive independent from Earth. His ambition quickly shifts when he discovers an accident with the station's birth control pills causes 20 women, including Jennifer, the woman he loves, to become pregnant. The rules on pregnancy are simple; a baby is a drain on resources and must be removed. John, his friends, and a large group of miners will do anything they can to prevent that, including declaring themselves the first independent colony outside of Earth.

Trance music is an emotional interpretation of one’s state of mind that is ever changing, blurry and exhilarating.

Now after years of doing sets and giving out mixtapes to friends - especially the highly anticipated annual ""Party on the New Years Eve"" series, If Gab is a DJ mixes are delivered straight to your iPods more then ever!

These mixes will be here as long as the music lived and as mind-blowing as trance will be to the world.

Though depressed about his early death, he befriends two other souls doing time there –  the writer Edgar Allan Poe and a fun-loving beach bum named Billy. Upon receiving a letter from God telling him he must learn some unnamed lessons before he can go to heaven, he convinces Poe to join him in the portal back to earth. They hope to make up for their past mistakes, but they arrive on earth in the year 2049, 42 years after Charles’ death. Traveling from mid-21st century New York City to Las Vegas, Charles seeks out the daughter he neglected in life, though she is now in her eighties. However, an unfriendly soul from Purgatory follows them to earth. This soul, an employee with whom Charles had an affair and summarily fired, is determined to keep him from winning passage to heaven. She teams up with Charles’ grandson, a debt-ridden gambling addict who has a talent for messing things up. Together, they hatch a scheme to foil Charles’ plan to get to heaven and net the grandson badly-needed money. Charles learns of their plans and enlists his friends to help stop them. Will they succeed?

Sound is attractive. It catches the ear, enchants, disturbs, and scares. But it is also imperative. Sound is both a means and an end. The decisive interest devoted to the ""strange"" reflexivity of sound
became a paradoxical instance of art, music and philosophy in the twentieth century. Further, it has encouraged the emergence of a genuine ""paradigm of listening"" from which I take steps to trace
the event of a conceptual category of plastic art so called Sound Art : Art of Sound, that reflecting on itself, defines its own historical context. 
Sound hits us where our disposition is already a move towards the ""given"" sound, for that hearing which accords and affords us whatever there really is to hear. Which means there is an ""eventual"" sound, which happens in-between me and the things in-between me and others: Sound originates ""elsewhere"" even though we are implicated. The sound of the voice is also erotic. It's like an intercourse in between own and alien. It's magnetic and it orients us in space, it defines boundaries and mixes the real and the imagined. We can experience the public nature of the audience, the spatiality of sound in its symbolic occurrences in buildings that accommodate the aesthetic experience of sound: the theatre, concert hall, the square from the gallery, and the
auditorium of the woods. But this is not the proper meaning of sound in space, nor qualifies its access to a space. Sound is more of a timeless space. The body itself is an instrument that records its
environment while reconfiguring existing environments. In 2004 I coined the phrase ‘Acusmatic ethics’ to describe the interspecific character of sound and its synthetic temporality. If we understand that listening to something is to record it, recording itself is also a kind of ‘answering’
behavior. Obviously, radio, tapes, samplers are able to isolate, alter and focus the processes of distribution and use of sound. But in this direction, ""synthetic"" claims is more of a ""critique"" of instruments and traditional research, including electronic, plastic art that belongs to music ""educated"" and that ""popular"" and doesn’t seem to characterize a specific field. This brought me to think of Radio as ethical space of sound and special environment of trading cultures and languages of contemporary art.

Those tools, coupled with a bag of spray cans, some linoleum and youthful expression, eventually gave birth to a movement. Today this movement is moving slower than ever due to the heavy traffic of mainstream media and narrowing paths of creativity that many choose to take. But fortunately there is still a lane available that allows this movement and its travelers to continue moving forward at a steady pace. That lane is Ill Street Grooves. Here on Ill Street we&#8217;re all about this movement we call Hip-Hop. We celebrate all aspects of it from the producer to the listener, the bomber to the art buyer, the needle to the groove and the major label artist all the way down to the local MC. Not only do we explore the direction music is currently heading in, but we also map it back to its roots in Funk, Reggae, Soul, Rock and Jazz. And every night on Ill Street is like a block party featuring performances and interviews with a wide range of artists, guest DJ sets, live music jam sessions, on-the-spot ciphers, and more. Every Monday night ease on down Ill Street from 10-11pm on 89.3fm WPFW in DC (or www.wpfw.org for a live feed online) and let us take you for a ride, or else&#8230;&#8230;.you may end up in that damn traffic!

As to the plot, if you don't know it already, let me just say that it involves two young English men who fall madly and instantly in love with two young English.women who of course love them back mainly because their name is Earnest.

To Amy, “It was finding something good in something bad.” Amy’s first big internet radio interview was with MSNBC/NBC Political Director, Chuck Todd which happened during one of the most decisive primaries in America’s political history – the Potomac-Chesapeake Primaries.

A Celebration of Women, the Sacred Feminine and the Right Brain
Preview Video

Described as a “Cape Canaveral lift-off,” In Our Right Minds has been igniting audiences around the country with a dynamic message that guides women to their strength as leaders and men to strength without armor.   In a fun, multimedia performance featuring myth, history, characters, comedy, original songs, art and artifacts, Dale Allen takes us on an exploration of the Goddess archetype and leads us to the discovery of how profoundly ancient wisdom can strengthen us as modern men and women.  Get ready to shake up old assumptions, delve deep into the foundation of our collective psyche, and break ground for a new era.   “This powerful performance should be required viewing – not just for women and girls, but for men as well – it is chock full of information and inspiration.”  Suzie Galler, Esteemed Woman Foundation

Dale Allen is a 15-year veteran of business and commercial communications with hundreds of live presentations, voice-overs, and on-camera projects for BMW, General Electric, and Canon (among others).  An accomplished lecturer, facilitator, playwright, and actress, Dale was recently a featured speaker at the Kauai Wellness Expo with Dr. Wayne Dyer.
“Dale Allen speaks to the heart and soul of all women regardless of their personal histories…she reminds us how connected we are to one another and to our ancestral mothers and teachers.”  Dr. Dale Atkins

This is the 1909 edition. The 1909 edition omits six stories from the original 1891 edition; these six stories are added to this LibriVox recording (from an undated English edition). The 1891 edition is entitled <i>In The Midst Of Life; Tales Of Soldiers And Civilians</i>. The Wikipedia entry for the book uses the title <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians</i>. <br/><br/>

Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce (June 24, 1842 – after December 26, 1913) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist and satirist. Today, he is best known for his short story, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" and his satirical lexicon, <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>. The sardonic view of human nature that informed his work – along with his vehemence as a critic, with his motto ""nothing matters"" – earned him the nickname ""Bitter Bierce."" Despite his reputation as a searing critic, however, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including poet George Sterling and fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. This style often embraces an abrupt beginning, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, the theme of war, and impossible events. In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain a first-hand perspective on that country's ongoing revolution. While traveling with rebel troops, the elderly writer disappeared without a trace. Since the book is a compilation of short stories, there is not an overarching plot. However, there are literary elements, or plot devices, that are shared throughout. Bierce's stories often begin mid-plot, with relevant details withheld until the end, where the dramatic resolution unfolds differently than expected, to a degree where most are considered twist endings. His characters were described by George Sterling as: ""His heroes, or rather victims, are lonely men, passing to unpredictable dooms, and hearing, from inaccessible crypts of space, the voices of unseen malevolencies.""... Bierce served as a union soldier during the Civil War and his experiences as a soldier served as an inspiration for his writing, particularly for the Soldiers section. In this way, Bierce's war treatments anticipate and parallel Ernest Hemingway's later arrival, whereas the civilian tales later influence horror writers.

algae strung from his armor. For the first time in his life, he discovers
that monsters do roam the earth. And this one has been specifically looking

These stories will get your heart racing in thirty minutes or less as you plummet to the depths of human emotion and the desire to protect what is dearest when all hell breaks loose and there is no one there to do anything about it but an Average Joe...or an almost Average Joe.  Think of each episode as something like the Twilight Zone, with guns, knives, and whatever the hero can find to defend themselves and their families from the bad guys.  These are Basil's original action novels taken down to single episode bite size chunks that'll get your blood pressure up on the commute to the office, or while on the treadmill at the gym. 

From a former Navy Seal, to a dad trying to make things right for his son, to a bunch of twenty something adventurers high on an Alaskan mountain you'll get the hardcore action you crave.  Twice a month, delivered right to your MP3 player.

You want action?  You want pulse pounding excitement?  You want to see the bad guys get their due? 

Here it is in a way that only a guy named Basil can do.

It may be a peacetime disaster such as a flood, tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard or earthquake. It could be an enemy nuclear attack on the United States. In any type of general disaster, lives can be saved if people are prepared for the emergency, and know what actions to take when it occurs. <br/><br/>

This handbook, ""In Time of Emergency"" (1968), contains basic general information on both nuclear attack and major natural disasters. This general guidance supplements the specific instructions issued by local governments. Since special conditions may exist in some communities, the local instructions may be slightly different from this general guidance. In those cases, the local instructions should be followed. (Summary from Introduction)"	"A major emergency affecting a large number of people may occur anytime and anywhere. It may be a peacetime disaster such as a flood, tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard or earthquake. It could be an enemy nuclear attack on the United States. In any type of general disaster, lives can be saved if people are prepared for the emergency, and know what actions to take when it occurs. <br/><br/>

This handbook, ""In Time of Emergency"" (1968), contains basic general information on both nuclear attack and major natural disasters. This general guidance supplements the specific instructions issued by local governments. Since special conditions may exist in some communities, the local instructions may be slightly different from this general guidance. In those cases, the local instructions should be followed.

There is nothing new under the sun, they say. That is only relatively true. Just now, when we thought there was practically no portion of the earth's surface still unknown, when the discovery of a single lake or mountain, or the charting of a remote strip of coast line was enough to give a man fame as an explorer, one member of the daredevil explorers' craft has ""struck it rich."" Struck it so dazzlingly rich, indeed, that all his confrères may be pardoned if they gnash their teeth in chagrin and turn green with envy. The lucky man is Prof. Hiram Bingham of Yale, he whose hobby is South America. He has just announced that he has had the superb good fortune to discover an entire city, two thousand years old, a place of splendid palaces and temples and grim encircling walls, hidden away so thoroughly on the top of a well-nigh inaccessible mountain peak of the Peruvian Andes that the Spanish invaders of four hundred years ago never set eyes upon it. He calls it Machu Picchu. (From New York Times, June 15, 1913)

One hundred years ago in the summer of 1911, Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, returning in the summer of 1912 to excavate under the auspices of Yale and The National Geographic Society, and coming home to great acclaim and a spate of published articles and photos. He fully described the 1911 expedition and original find in his 1922 book INCA LANDS: Explorations in the Highlands of Peru.

Fra queste un fenomeno sempre più presente nelle nostre città è quello degli italiani di origine straniera. Sono circa 420mila i minori extracomuntari nati in Italia, ma senza cittadinanza. Lo storico film del ‘67 sui pregiudizi razziali, ""Indovina chi viene a cena"", è lo spunto per un  programma che si occupa di cucina e pregiudizi. Ogni settimana l'ospite, un italiano con radici altrove, ripercorrerà la sua storia e proporrà una ricetta del suo paese d'origine e una ricetta del posto in Italia dove attualmente vive. Fra cous cous e spaghetti alla carbonara intorno ai fornelli si parlerà di pregiudizi e contaminazioni, verso il cibo e non solo."

Working under the government's shroud of secrecy, CIA operative Dew Phillips crisscrosses the country trying in vain to capture a live victim. With only decomposing corpses for clues, CDC epidemiologist Margaret Montoya races to analyze the science behind this deadly contagion. She discovers that these killers all have one thing in common - they've been contaminated by a bioengineered parasite, shaped by a complexity far beyond the limits of known science.

Meanwhile Perry Dawsey - a hulking former football star now resigned to life as a cubicle-bound desk jockey - awakens one morning to find several mysterious welts growing on his body. Soon Perry finds himself acting and thinking strangely, hearing voices . . . he is infected.

The fate of the human race may well depend on the bloody war Perry must wage with his own body, because the parasites want something from him, something that goes beyond mere murder.

Infected is the first major print release from Internet phenom Scott Sigler, whose podcast-only audiobooks have drawn an immense cult following, with more than three million individual episodes downloaded. Now Sigler storms the bookstore shelves with this cinematic, relentlessly paced novel that mixes and matches genres, combining horror, technothriller, and suspense in a heady mix that is equal parts Chuck Palahniuk, Michael Crichton, and Stephen King.

Infected will crawl beneath your skin and leave fresh blood on every page.

QUOTES: 
""Part Stephen King, part Chuck Palahniuk, Infected blends science fiction and horror into a pulpy masterpiece of action, terror, and suspense.  Three recommendations: don't read it at night, or just after you've eaten a full meal, or if you're weak of heart.  You've been warned!""
--James Rollins, New York Times bestselling author of The Judas Strain and Black Order

""Sigler is masterful at grabbing the reader by the throat and refusing to let go. Just when I thought I knew what abyss he was leading me across, he knocked the bridge out from under... I think I screamed the whole way down... Infected is a marvel of gonzo, in-your-face, up-to-the-minute terror.""
--Lincoln Child, New York Times bestselling author of Deep Storm and Death Match

""Sigler is the Richard Matheson of the 21st Century...smart and creepy, Infected is a flawless thinking-person's thriller. Bravo to a bold new talent!""
--Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bad Moon Rising and Ghost Road Blues

""Horror mavens rejoice! Infected is a revelation -- a novel that lives up to its hype. From page one, the story of a mysterious smart-virus that turns its hosts into deadly drooling drones creeps up on a reader like the ratchet of a roller coaster climbing toward its inevitable crest. Sigler brings the folksy character detail of Stephen King, the conceptual panache of Clive Barker, and the oozing, shuddery pathologies of a David Cronenberg movie. Zombies, spies, conspiracies, and gallons of goo make this the fastest read in the west! Highest recommendation!""
-- Jay Bonansinga, national bestselling author of Shattered, Twisted, Frozen, and The Sinking of the Eastland

""Sigler has a unique talent for keeping readers on the edge of their seats; I absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. Infected is full of mayhem, action, and gore--and you won't be able to put it down.""
-- Dave Wellington, author of 13 Bullets and the Monster Island trilogy

""Scott Sigler's Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you've got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.""
--Joe R. Lansdale, World Horror Convention Grand Master and six-time Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Bubba Ho-Tep and Lost Echoes"	"Across America a mysterious disease is turning ordinary people into raving, paranoid murderers who inflict brutal horrors on strangers, themselves, and even their own families.

This also enables Sally to lead an all important peace mission to Baltan.  The cold war with Baltan is finally showing signs of ending with the return of Mercy Collins, and Sally spends a year on the city trying to forge a new relationship with Earth.  But now her associate commissioner arrives with a new problem.  New Ontario, a planet Sally has visited before, is suddenly becoming important again.  The cruel ""masters"" who rule the planet have apparently been displaced by a band of rebels with mysterious powers.  Growing on the surface of this world is a massive structure that is generating enormous power.  Earth wants answers, and Sally is being asked to help.  But she won't do it alone.  No human is immune to the Masters' influence, but perhaps non-humans would be.  Sally accelerates another project she has been quietly overseeing.  She contacts Ian, who has been tasked to make first contact with the Szzzyyyxx, a peaceful, if unusual species on the other side of a fold beyond the asteroid belt.  Sally must put a strain on this new friendship to ask for help in what could easily deteriorate into a war.  Because more is happening on New Ontario than just an insurrection.  A band of former slaves now have the aid of a mysterious benefactor who is using them to build a machine that bends time.  But who is this benefactor and what does he want?  The answer is more terrifying than the question.  Now Sally must work to prevent a disaster that could have implications throughout all of human history."

Thanks for visiting our PODCAST.  ”The Inflatable Ferret” is a monthly online music news publication and social community based out of New York, but it branches out all over the United States. We offer our humble opinions about the latest and the not-so-latest in music.  Our aim is to develop a consistent and less politically charged approach to analyzing music. We’ll try to introduce readers to new chambers of music, while at the same time remembering the old ones. Of course, we realize there are other art forms out there, so we will also focus on film, literature, and visual art. That said, our key focus is music. As we attempt to gain a deeper appreciation for music ourselves, we hope to peak your interest in some of our favorite artists and albums.

I guess I owe you the story behind the name of the magazine. The day we interviewed the White Rabbits, Hans Larsen, Ryan Waring, and I stopped by a yard sale. At this time the magazine still didn’t have a solid name. We had considered Misanthrope, but none of us was sold on the name. After ten careless minutes at the sale, we stumbled upon a box of inflatable ferrets from 1987 that we assume to have been used for educational purposes by the World Wildlife Fund. Later that night, Hans and I decided we should have some kind of trademark to include in a photo of every band we interview. We slowly turned our heads, each knowing what the other was thinking. From then on, we called ourselves The Inflatable Ferret. Everyone involved in the Ferret is either a full-time student or a full-time employee as well.We warmly invite constructive (even destructive) criticism, and we are always looking for fresh faces to contribute, so please don’t hesitate to contact us at info@inflatableferret.com. We realize you’re busy, so we appreciate the time you’re taking to visit, and hopefully you’ll enjoy it enough to read our posts and issues to come."	""

Through engaging in casual conversation, I encourage my guests to present a side of themselves that is not often seen in the classroom, office, or on the field or court. By allowing my guests to display a diverse representation of their best selves, I hope that members of the U of C community will feel more comfortable approaching, conversing, and working with people who may be more experienced, and further along in their academic careers than they are, and vice versa."

La comunicazione scientifica accessibile a tutti

I vulcani, per la loro spettacolarità come manifestazione incontrollabile della natura, i paesaggi mozzafiato, le eruzioni, creano nello spettatore normodotato, un turbinio di emozioni così forti da non riuscire a staccare gli occhi da quegli eventi naturali. Ed è questa la motivazione per la quale i vulcani nel mondo vengono sempre rappresentati attraverso documentari su grande e piccolo schermo, mostre fotografiche e libri di immagini.
L’Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), in collaborazione con Italian Podcast Network (IPN), Freerumble e  CulturAbile Onlus, ha confezionato i vulcani italiani in podcast audio, con un’attenzione particolare verso il mondo della disabilità sensoriale (persone sorde e cieche). Come? Se un podcast audio è, per sua natura, più fruibile da parte delle persone cieche, il nuovo podcast audio sarà in realtà accessibile anche alle persone sorde grazie alla trascrizione dell’audio stesso. Perché fare cultura significa progettare e pensare in modo ‘accessibile’. 
Ma senza cavalcare l’handicap, i vulcani in podcast sono strumenti comodamente utilizzabili nei nostri i-pod, fruibili mentre guidiamo o facciamo jogging.
La squadra che lavora per i vulcani in podcast  fa parte di uno staff di vulcanologi altamente qualificati provenienti da Enti di ricerca e Università, esperti in comunicazione nel settore dell’accessibilità, giornalisti scientifici, tecnici dell’audiodescrizione e del respeaking (tecnica di trascrizione del parlato – spontaneo e pianificato – tramite l’utilizzo di un software di riconoscimento vocale).
Negli audio verranno spiegate in modo autorevole, ma molto comprensibile come nasce un vulcano, cioè la storia geologica, la storia eruttiva, i prodotti delle eruzioni, il monitoraggio per i vulcani attivi, la possibilità di riattivazione futura, descrizione di strutture vulcaniche riconoscibili, come ad esempio resti di fumarole o antichi crateri, possibili sfruttamenti geotermici.
I podcast sono liberamente scaricabili dal Canale Freerumble dell’INGV, I-tunes, Italian Podcast Network (IPN), CulturAbile Onlus (con player accessibile agli screen reader usati dalle persone con disabilità visiva)."	la nuova era del podcasting italiano ha inizio ora.

Dj’s, Producers and label owners of Drop Music, Borrowed and Raise Recordings.
            Ritchie and Riley hail from Nottingham UK, a city with a rich musical legacy, particularly for House Music.They met in ’93 and cut their teeth Dj’ing for Smokescreen, the renegade sound system from which they drew their early inspiration. Smokescreen consisted of dj’s, lighting people, sound people, a truck, a P.A, a generator and general helpers. Old warehouses, woodland, fields, quarries and houses were utilized with the sole intention of having a good time…. for free! By the mid 90’s smokescreen could guarantee a crowd of hundreds in attendance at their parties, and their club nights became local institutions that ran for years with packed dancefloors, and still do to this day!
            By ’98 Laurence and Andy had made the inevitable step into production and the same year the Drop Music label was born with the release of ‘Inland Knights vol 1’. As Inland Knights Riley and Ritchie undertook a busy recording schedule to write tracks for Drop (almost all of the early output was entirely Inland knights, despite many monikers). Drop Music has gone on to become one of the most highly regarded house labels in recent years(with 67 plus releases to date), and Inland Knights have gone on to become one of the most respected production outfits in the house world, regularly taking on remix and Ep duties for fellow labels and producers. Highlights include the acclaimed ‘Mohammed Ali’ remix for Faithless on Cheeky Records, CD compilations and remixes for NRK and Om Records, three Ep's on 2020 Vision, Inland Knights first full length album entitled ‘Creative Spaces’, and more recently, Inland Knights album to mark 10 years of Drop Music entitled ‘Dust till Dawn’, not to mention countless Ep's on other labels over the years.
            Currently, as well as remix, production and Label commitments, the pair maintain a busy international Dj’ing schedule, and can be found most weekends playing somewhere in the UK or Europe, as well as regular visits to the U.S, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Laurence and Andy also record under the alias's Larry Fives and Toka Project respectively.

When you dive into Mark Twain’s (Samuel Clemens’) The Innocents Abroad, you have to be ready to learn more about the unadorned, ungilded reality of 19th century “touring” than you might think you want to learn. This is a tough, literary journey. It was tough for Twain and his fellow “pilgrims”, both religious and otherwise. They set out, on a June day in 1867, to visit major tourist sites in Europe and the near east, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, “the Holy Land”, and Egypt. What Twain records, in often humorous, sometimes grotesque but always fascinating detail, are the day-to-day ups and downs of discovering the truth about people and places. The truths they learn are often far different than their education and rumor have made them preconceive.
<BR><BR>
This is a voyage of discovery. It’s long and, in places, tiresome. But it’s revelatory about so much. As with some of his other works, Twain includes popular prejudices of his time, which are today considered socially unacceptable. His references to “Indians”, “Negroes” and “infidels” come to mind.

Beyond the lows, though, there are the highs of Twain’s cutting wit and insight as he guides us along the bumpy and often dangerous voyage.

Press coverage of news in school food tends to be superficial, with emphasis on what&#x2019;s negative and sensational. School food professionals and other insiders know different, and here they get their chance to dig deeper and talk shop about the issues that loom largest and the solutions that work best. Each week, guests from across the nation explore a different topic from a selection that addresses a spectrum of concerns around coping with regulation, meeting sustainability goals, and creating kid-friendly menus that are fresh, healthy, delicious, and affordable. Have a subject to suggest? Let us know. If you&#x2019;re inside school food, this is your conversation.&#xD;

Laura Stanley knows first hand how effective the food service industry can be in catalyzing reforms that are good for people and the environment. For twenty years, her work as a journalist and project manager has supported pioneers across the restaurant and institutional food supply chain who are demonstrating how a healthy, sustainable, just and humane food system can be possible and profitable."

Insight for Living Ministries, the Bible-teaching radio ministry of Chuck Swindoll, is committed to excellence in communicating the truths of Scripture and the person of Jesus Christ in an accurate, clear, and practical manner.  Our desire is for people to grow in their understanding of God's plan for their lives and also to mature as authentic Christians.&lt;br /&gt;

In the summer of 1977, the sermons that Chuck Swindoll preached at the First Evangelical Free Church in Fullerton, California, were broadcast on 27 stations in the United States. Listeners responded immediately to the lively message of this down-to-earth pastor who could communicate God's truth in terms they could understand and apply to their lives. In 1979, the radio ministry of Insight for Living was officially born, beginning on just a handful of stations.&lt;br /&gt;

Today, more than two thousand stations carry the program around the world in six different languages.  Insight for Living Ministries' headquarters is located in Plano, Texas. We also maintain offices in Boronia for our Australian listeners, in São Paulo for our Brazilian listeners, in Abbotsford, British Columbia for our Canadian listeners, and in Dorking for our listeners in the United Kingdom and Europe.

of the Catholic Faith
have been neglected
and the faithful are
in great need
of intellectual faith formation,
the Institute of Catholic Culture
stands as a sign of hope.

Taking our Lord's final command
to the Apostles
to ""make disciples of all nations,""
as our own,
the Institute of Catholic Culture
was founded in answer to the Church's
call for a ""New Evangelization.""

To this end,
the Institute hosts educational seminars
specifically designed to build bridges of understanding,
teaching authentic Catholic
history, philosophy, and theology
as a way of healing the wounds
in the Body of Christ,
and reaching our to those who seek knowledge
of the Truth.

Welcoming some of the most influential teachers
of our time,
the Institute offers participants
an organic formation
in the Catholic Faith
while providing a social setting
where the Faith is not only learned,
but lived.
All are welcome to join
the Institute of Catholic Culture
and seek the Truth revealed
in out Lord and God,
Jesus Christ."	The restoration of Catholic adult education

The over-arching theme of the book – and Calvin's greatest theological legacy – is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in salvation and election.<br/><br/>

The Institutes are a primary reference for the system of doctrine adopted by the Reformed churches, usually called Calvinism. <br/><br/>

Book Four of the Institutes discusses ""the Church and the Communion of Saints, or of the external means or helps by which God invites us to fellowship with Christ, and keeps us in it."" This includes Church government, with scathing denunciations of the Papacy and Catholic Church. (Summary from Wikipedia & TriciaG)<br/><br/>"

Something different, its what we call: Junkie Sound.
We believe that music is free, so, we share all our works, although, we buy all our music, and pay the artists for their work.
Intellectual Junkies have a different plan in mind... We play, record and then share. We love the dancefloors, but we love to study sets too, so we choose to work in a studio and produce sets that we will share for sure.
Give us your feedback if you want to, but we dont really care about fame. We care a lot for constructive critics.

We think it offers an interesting story and over the next few months we hope you will join us as we share it.   But be forewarned.

He discovered his true love for music when he came to UMASS Amherst and people needed someone to play music for the party.

As the EDM scene began to broaden throughout the U.S., Mikey's keen sense for music and how to work a crowd became more and more popular at every party. He quickly realized that the EDM scene was calling his name and he answered the call with fury.

In October of 2011, he purchased the necessary equipment to start up his adventure in becoming a true DJ. Since then, he has been on the decks almost every day perfecting his trade. His popularity is exploding and he has already been a Dj for local nightlife hotspots, featured in local events such as GloCrazy, and is a resident DJ on a Global Internet Radio website (www.undergroundsessions.net) every week, not to mention the massive parties all around massachusetts. His ability to learn very quickly is proving to be useful as it seems only the sky is the limit for this young DJ."	Get ready........

As of late, I’ve become more aware of certain issues with how we view culture and identity, especially in terms of how they are often seen as solid constructs. As this world becomes an increasingly global place, we are becoming more connected with each other and this means that issues of how to address culture and identity are becoming more relevant. There is no simple answer to how to deal with these ideas but this podcast aims to explore them as much as possible. Each episode, I’ll have a new guest on the show to explore these issues through their own personal experiences.

This podcast is an experiment in dealing with certain frustrations while finding humor in other situations. Most of all, this podcast is about trying to understand our own identities better or, at the very least, it’s about coming to terms with how impossible that can be."	""

Ethan, a digital sound engineer in Los Angeles, becomes aware that his life is unraveling when the audiobook he's listening to reveals his deepest, darkest secrets, escalating until the narrator addresses him directly, threatening to destroy him from within.  Vivian, a single mother running an antique store in San Francisco, listens to her audiobook to distract herself from missing her young daughter, but is shaken when the narrative is interrupted by her daughter's voice, faintly calling for help.  

Ethan and Vivian are drawn together as they fight to solve a generation-spanning conspiracy that begins with a boy listening to the Orson Welles broadcast of War of the Worlds in 1938 and evolves through the latest innovations in digital technology, unearthing the mind-bending concept of a POSSIBILITY PARASITE bent on unleashing an explosion of APOCALYPTIC META HORROR.

Straining against the bonds of Tidewater society and tempted by an ancient legent, Jonathan's sense of adventure leads him over the mountains of southwest Virginia. Perils abound for this brave pioneer, who must face threats from the native tribes, the British, and even more sinister enemies, while fighting for the woman he loves, and the land that will not let go of his heart. Based on a true story, Into the Woods is a tale of adventure, danger, love, and the triumph of the human spirit.

PRAISE FOR INTO THE WOODS:

""David Wood has crafted a gem of a story laced with action, villainy, revenge, and reconciliation. Adventure, loyalty- sometimes strained and split- love and sacrifice resonate within the pages of this historical fiction tale."" Terry W. Ervin II, author of Flank Hawk

""Into the Woods is an amazing historical adventure, and a powerful testament to the power of family."" Sean Ellis, author of The Shroud of Heaven

""David Wood has written an entertaining historical adventure."" Megalith Book Reviews

PRAISE FOR DAVID WOOD:

""Cibola by David Wood is a page-turning yarn blending high action, Biblical speculation, ancient secrets, and nasty creatures. Indiana Jones better watch his back!"" Jeremy Robinson, author of Instinct and Beneath

""With the thoroughly enjoyable way Mr. Wood has mixed speculative history with our modern day pursuit of truth, he has created a story that thrills and makes one think beyond the boundaries of mere fiction and enter the world of 'why not'?"" David Golemon, author of Leviathan and Ancients

""Ancient cave paintings? Cities of gold? Secret scrolls? Sign me up! Cibola is a twisty tale of adventure and intrigue that never lets up and never lets go!"" Robert Masello, author of Bestiary and Blood and Ice

""History is turned on its head in this gripping tale of sects, secrets, and double-crosses. With mesmerizing treasures in beautiful locations, beautiful women and rugged heroes, mysticism and mystery, Wood spins a yarn that keeps the pages turning.""

Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing Geist or spirit. Geist is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the “cunning of reason”. Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history. The obscure writings of Jakob Böhme had a strong effect on Hegel. Böhme had written that the Fall of Man was a necessary stage in the evolution of the universe. This evolution was, itself, the result of God’s desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Spinoza, Kant, Rousseau, and Goethe, and by the French Revolution. Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, self and Other, freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Hegel’s main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called “the absolute idea” or “absolute knowledge”.  According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in contradiction and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of reality—consciousness, history, philosophy, art, nature, society—leads to further development until a rational unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts through an up-lifting (Aufhebung) into a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, logical, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious whole is not a thing or being that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself.(summary by wikipedia and d.e. wittkower)	The introduction to Hegel’s lectures on the philosophy of world history is often used to introduce students to Hegel’s philosophy, in part because Hegel’s sometimes difficult...

W. Wilson providing the naval chapters). It is one of the more famous examples of Invasion literature and is an example of pre-World War I Germanophobia, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany. The book takes the form of a military history and includes excerpts from the characters' journals and letters and descriptions of the fictional German campaign itself. The novel originally appeared in serial form in the Daily Mail newspaper from 19 March 1906, and was a huge success. The newspaper's circulation increased greatly, and it made a small fortune for Le Queux, eventually being translated into twenty-seven languages and selling over one million copies in book form.

It is centered on an invasion by the Germans, who have managed to land a sizable invasion force on the East Coast of England. They advance inland, cutting all telegraph lines and despoiling farmland as they go, and the British struggle to mount a proper defense. The Germans eventually reach London and occupy half the city. A junior Member of Parliament declares that ""Britain is not defeated"" and organizes a resistance movement, the ""League of Defenders"", despite harsh reprisals by the Germans and a severe lack of arms. The Germans seem unable to combat this and tighten their control of London, and suddenly find themselves faced with a popular uprising. Eventually a newly-formed British Army marches to liberate London. The fictional war, however, is a stalemate since it appears that German forces have managed to occupy Belgium and the Netherlands. (Introduction by Wikipedia)"	"This novel, also known as The Invasion of 1910, is a 1906 novel written mainly by William Le Queux (with H. W. Wilson providing the naval chapters). It is one of the more famous examples of Invasion literature and is an example of pre-World War I Germanophobia, as it preached the need to prepare for war with Germany. The book takes the form of a military history and includes excerpts from the characters' journals and letters and descriptions of the fictional German campaign itself.

Nahda tog til Irak for at fejre brylluppet med sang og musik - selv om religiøse militser skyder irakere, der fester på den måde. Nahda sørgede for at have bevæbnede vagter med til brylluppet, som kunne skyde igen, når det blev nødvendigt. For sådan er hun - hele sit liv har hun kæmpet mod diktatur og religiøs undertrykkelse i Irak. I første program i udsendelsesrækken ’Irak - hvad nu?’ taler P1’s Gitte Hansen og Claus Pilehave med Nahda Jaber Jassem, der netop er vendt hjem fra endnu en rejse til Irak - om hendes oplevelser med Saddam-regimet, og om udsigten til en dag at returnere til et fredeligt Irak.

I løbet af de i alt fem P1-programmer præsenteres lytterne også for Camp Einherjers feltpræst Peter N. Sporleder, tidligere chef for Forsvarsakademiet Karsten Møller og hjemmeværnsofficer - og indtil for nylig chefinstruktør på en NATO-støttet irakisk officersskole - Ulrich Erhardtsen. Hver især har de draget erfaringer af indsatsen i Irak og hjælper med at tegne et billede af det Irak, de danske styrker forlader.

Serien ""Irak - hvad nu?"" tegner igennem fem samtaleprogrammer et billede af en region, hvor man stadigvæk står overfor mange udfordringer før freden er sikret."	"I Irak har der aldrig været demokrati, derfor kan vi heller ikke med magt indføre demokratiet på få år, det kommer til at tage et halvt århundrede.
Det mener Karsten - han er netop stoppet som chef for Forsvarsakademiet. Hvis vi vil indføre demokrati i diktaturstater, så kræver det moderne soldater, der er mere diplomater og mindre krigere. Det kræver kulturforståelse og konfliktløsning. Men den uddannelse mangler soldaterne i de internationale styrker, bl.a. derfor går det så galt i Irak.

Mød Karsten Møller - han er gæst i samtaleprogrammet: Irak - hvad nu?"

Dancer, choreographer, performer, actress, philosopher, and vocalist Irena Tomažin made her first appearance in the area of music with the group Kapricjoke, which appeared also in the Concert Marathon organised by Radio Student. However, her most noteworthy debut presentation in the field of sound was made with a solo recital iT for voice and voice recorders, in which Tomažin ingeniously weaves the story through the primary human instrument – the voice. Hers is not a trained voice based on clear articulation and technical brilliance. Quite the contrary, its power of expression draws precisely from the failure of articulation, from its incessant attempts to constitute itself, with which it often drifts away from the field of meaning and enters the field of sound. We are dealing thus with a fragile voice, a voice in search of itself, which nevertheless has a profuse emotional and expressive potential. At the same time, it is also an alienated voice, which is – since it is recorded on dictaphones – becoming an acousmatic object, alienated from corporeality, but which is re-entering the semantically structured storyline through repetitions of sound loops and tape manipulation. Voice, a fundamental corporeal experience, is traversed by countless voices, multiplying, dissolving, and confronting their own semantic and sound resonances in space. To dramaturgically round up her (sound) narration, Irena Tomažin artfully, sometimes movingly, and sometimes playfully, employs different means: from adopting and breaking the tunes from the sphere of popular music, theatrical story-telling to playing with the words’ syllables and their rhythm, dismantling the words in the style of literary modernisms and avantgardisms of the previous century, or reducing the voice to panting, smacking, sighing. However, in so doing she is still allowing multiple voices to speak at the same time, in harmonies and cacophonies. Although her creativity can be compared to certain more visible contemporaries (such as Meredith Monk, for example), Tomažin’s performance is unique in its child-like playfulness, which is occasionally also capable of sparkly self-reflection. Although her performance ever-so-slightly implied a rather schizophrenic story of submission, which addressed the audience through multiple voices simultaneously, these voices nevertheless incessantly communicated in the in-between space of the word and condensed meaning. Recently, appearing as iT, Tomažin’s voice is dissolving from a structured and distorted one, from veiled polyphony, to a naked voice, which is ultimately left almost voiceless, residually remaining in the body, where the possibilities and the impossibility of its articulation are taken over by gesture, movement. As iT, Irena Tomažin as a matter of fact thinks voice through heterogeneous trains of thought, which intensely, via extremely personal experience, traverse one another. This discloses her experience as a philosopher who confronts her thought with other thinkers of the voice, such as, for example, Mladen Dolar or Jacques Derrida, or literature, such as, the literary thought of Samuel Beckett, or the thinking of Antonin Artaud on contemporary theatre, or the melodies of most diverse traditions. As iT, Irena Tomažin performs at home and abroad, also in important international festivals, such as Club 5 in Vienna, Dispatch in Belgrade, Densités in France, and Ultrahang in Budapest. In recent years, she has also lent her voice to free improvised music, collaborating with numerous home and foreign makers. These include the bassist Tomaž Grom, the multitalented musician Andrej Fon, the saxophonist Marko Karlovčec, and others. With the latter she also released a record ‘That Which Happens Is Itself Dripping Red’. Internationally, she is collaborating with the American brass musician Liz Allbee, the Japanese percussionist Seijiro Murayama, and others.

Ms Jane Barlow, an Irish lass, having, unbelievably, an uncertain date of birth, has a turn of phrase that delights and simultaneously enmeshes the reader/listener with compassion for her tableau. She captures the tune and lilt of dialogue so delightfully. A tiny sample: ""So, by hook or by crook, Lisconnel holds together from year to year, with no particular prospect of changes; though it would be safe enough to prophesy that should any occur, they will tend towards the falling in of derelict roofs, and the growth of weeds round deserted hearthstones and crumbling walls."" Although of high social standing, I suspect she might have been a “left-footer” but maybe not, her sympathies lying so dramatically with local Irish peasants of her acquaintance. She portrays a decided antipathy toward English rule/subjection of these peasants along with a rather stark anti-clerical and anti-religious leaning, which I find somewhat unusual for the time. But there it is at the end of the day. This book, Irish Idylls, published in 1893, was perhaps her greatest success and was followed by a sequel Strangers at Lisconnel in 1895, which, God willing, we may also get to in due course.

Immature? Definitely. 
Sophomoric? Unabashedly. 
Enlightening? 

Listen in as a self-entitled, pessimistic Jew and an intolerably likable Guido do their best to find ways to make arguing about nothing a modern form of entertainment.  
Ever wonder what sex toys are like in the wizarding world of Harry Potter? Or whether nipple color should be used when trying to classify a person's race? Ever dream that your friend has an imaginary sister who only exists to seduce you?

Some three-fourths of the distance between America and Europe there is a group of nine beautiful islands called the Azores which belong to Portugal. Their names are Flores, Corvo, Fayal, Pico, S. Jorge, Graciosa, Terceira, S. Miguel, and Santa Maria. Many people think them to be the mountain peaks of the submerged continent, Atlantis, which long ago was covered by the ocean.However, when I spent December 1920 and January 1921 in the Azores, I found that there were not only pleasant folktales there but even real fairies.

ISSUE ORIENTED began with Australian radio personality Sarah DeBorre and I discussing crucial issues and playing awesome music. It was originally a monthly segment on Headwealth - Australia's premiere hardcorepunkmetal radio show (airing on 106.7 PBS FM in Melbourne). Sarah planned a leave of absence from PBS so that she could travel, but I didn't want to miss the opportunity to do more radio. And so as podcasts began to enter the mainstream, ISSUE ORIENTED took its current form. Now - thanks to the web and podcasting - you can listen to ISSUE ORIENTED any time, anywhere.

Occasionally sharing their personal experiences.We aim to talk you humorously through the relationship journey, from the moment you started to flirt, getting the number,asking him/her out, to actually going out, getting bored, wondering if they're cheating, to wanting to break up, to winning him/her back...we got your back, no matter what! No subject is taboo enough for these 5 comics who are hell bent  on bringing more sex and love into your lives whether your are a single male/female, in a relationship, a player, a gold digger. We've got something for everybody, so why not tune in and hear what we're talking about.	Coz thinking is not yet illegal!

Vivere in una società basata su infinite sollecitazioni acustiche e visive, oggi ancora precluse a quasi cinque milioni di cittadini italiani con sordità e cecità, senza mettere in atto semplici tecniche e strategie per l&#8217;accessibilità culturale, significa perdere non solo una sfida sociale, ma anche economica e umana. In questa trasmissione introduciamo alcuni degli strumenti a disposizione di tutti per rendere accessibili molte occasioni &#8216;culturali&#8217; ai disabili sensoriali, con esiti, sviluppi e riscontri che possono andare davvero a vantaggio di tutti.

Veneto, In fondo a destra, domenica mattina e Vincenzo Caruso. Risposte che non hanno una domanda.
&#8220;Distinti starnuti&#8221; vi offrirà un surrogato di podcast nuovissimi e futuristici, con tanti personaggi, idee e mondi paralleli a cura di quei mattacchioni de &#8220;Le Stupide Creature&#8221;.
Tutto partirà da due serissimi conduttori che, appassionati musica contemporanea, registrano podcast in una cameretta polverosa. Tale condizione li costringerà a starnutire talmente forte da riuscire a disconnettere il server che, dopo vari scossoni, andrà a registrare i podcast dell&#8217;etere in tempo reale.
Podcast Emo, Podcast Hard, Podcast News sono solo alcuni dei mondi internet che sveleranno potenzialità e difetti di questo mezzo di comunicazione in continua espansione.

Attraversando i numerosi movimenti culturali, fucina in cui si sono forgiati registi leggendari, per talento, visione e tecnica, analizzeremo quelle opere che a nostro parere sono, e lo rimarranno per sempre, i film più importanti mai realizzati in ambito planetario.
In questo lungo viaggio, mosso dalla passione genuina che da sempre ci anima, affronteremo insieme, senza eccedere con toni noiosamente didattici, come se fosse una chiacchierata tra amici che se ne intendono, i temi che di volta in volta si renderanno espliciti: dal proverbiale scetticismo dei fratelli Lumiére al vergognoso degrado culturale di questa nostra epoca, quasi fosse un nuovo medioevo per cui la scena artistica nazionale sta pagando un prezzo decisamente alto."	la nuova era del podcasting italiano ha inizio ora.

Quella che inizialmente ha fattezze di gabbia, ovvero di un cubicolo (= stanza di piccole dimensioni senza finestre, camera sepolcrale) è, spesso, la posizione mentale che adottiamo nei riguardi della nostra stessa vita. Quando ci risulta troppo stretta e angusta, la possiamo trasformare grazie a qualche spiraglio di luce che ci permetta un nuovo sguardo sul mondo, quello interiore che ci appartiene e quello esteriore, di cui siamo per lo più spettatori.
Il cubicolo con 33 piccole fessure, da cui la luce può filtrare ricreando l’ambiente, è diventato quindi il mio KuBkolo33. Come funziona?
KuBkolo33 è un gioco. Un gioco di agganci, di collegamenti, di salti da un luogo all’altro, ma con una logica ferrea, con delle regole precise.
Il titolo della puntata è l’argomento iniziale, la stanza senza finestre, il cubicolo soffocante e buio dal quale si parte. Introdotto il TOPIC (= argomento) procedo per links che io ho chiamato CRACKS (= fessure), per restare fedeli all’immagine che vi ho già illustrato. Ogni Crack che posiziono sul mio tavolo da gioco virtuale ha a che fare con il topic. Ognuno è una fessura che impongo ai muri della stanza/prigione affinché la luce possa filtrare dall’esterno. Spesso un Crack rimanda ad un altro, con effetto BigDominoRally (avete presente i mattoncini messi in piedi, in fila, che ne butti giù uno e in scala cadono tutti? Ecco, l’effetto voluto è quello). I Cracks hanno a che fare con l’arte (musica, scrittura, cinema, pittura, scultura, ecc.), le scienze, la storia, la geografia… senza confini di sorta, tutto quello che ci riporta, in qualche modo e inesorabilmente, al topic iniziale.
I CRACKS sono rigorosamente 33 per ogni puntata. Regola base: posso seguire il percorso che da un Crack mi porta ad un altro, se il tema iniziale si mantiene presente, o posso ritornare al punto di partenza, aprire una nuova finestra e intraprendere un nuovo percorso con la messa in gioco di altri cracks. L’importante è non discostarmi troppo dal topic iniziale. La sfida (con me stessa) non è soltanto di concludere un percorso logico in 33 cracks e far tornare i conti, sempre, ma è soprattutto quella di riuscire a farvi rimanere all’ascolto, senza annoiarvi, lì con me, dall’inizio alla fine della puntata. Anzi, dall’inizio alla fine di questa avventura che prevede 11 puntate.

The manuscript is made up of Leland's notebooks, which were first published in the 18th century, and later in a ten-part, five-volume edition published by Lucy Toulmin (1906-10). Part IX of the manuscript begins in the south of England and gradually meanders its way, county by county, through central and northern England up to the borders of Scotland. Leland did not prepare the manuscript for publication and it is sometimes difficult to follow, with occasional geographically-misplaced sections, lists of headings with content yet to be added, and the odd lapse into Latin. Part IX of the Itinerary will be of interest, nevertheless, to anyone with an interest in English history as an early form of the 'gazetteer', compiled at a time when the shape of the country as a whole was still a mystery to most of its inhabitants. Leland's spellings tend to be inconsistent and for the most part I have used modern pronunciations unless a consistent spelling clearly indicates a different pronunciation. I have also omitted or modified a few short passages that would be otherwise incomprehensible.

We are used to looking at the dancer’s body in performance as a body that is continuously in motion, a masterful body productive in its movement, a non-interrupted kinetic spectacle. However, if we stop that body in passage and take a step forward, toward the idea of dance as an act that also includes periods without movement, cracks or “negative spaces” of dance, we open up to the potential for a structural use of the void and stillness in contemporary choreography. Stepping and walking, stillness and silence, jumping and falling – these are some of the notions that I will be using to describe the work of Leja Jurišič, Selma Banich and Željka Sančanin, referencing canonical authors Trish Brown and Steve Paxton.

Ivana Ivković (1975) studies at the Department of Dramaturgy at the Academy of Drama Arts in Zagreb. She is the editor-in-chief of Frakcija Journal for Performing Arts and collaborates with several other publications, the Center for Drama Art and has worked as the general coordinator of Zagreb – Cultural Kapital of Europe 3000, a project jointly organized by Zagreb’s eight independent cultural organizations from the fields of performing arts, new media, visual arts, architecture and theory. She has collaborated in the past with Zagreb based independent theater company oour (dance productions: orangecut [2004], To be Confirmed [2005]) and is a member of collaborative artistic company BADco. (Deleted Messages, Fleshdance in 2004, research project in 2005, memories are made of this…, Protest and Negotiation in 2006, 1 poor and one 0 in 2008, The League of Time in 2009). She is the co-editor of the textual and pictorial reader DemoKino – Virtual Biopolitical Agora with Davide Grassi (Aksioma and Maska, 2006)."

Sir Henry Wotton (1568 – 1639) was an English author, diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1614 and 1625. He is often quoted as saying, ""An ambassador is an honest gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country.” Richard Hooker (1554 – 1600) was an Anglican priest and an influential theologian. Hooker's emphases on reason, tolerance and the value of tradition came to exert a lasting influence on the development of the Church of England. In retrospect he has been taken (with Thomas Cranmer and Matthew Parker) as a founder of Anglican theological thought. George Herbert (1593 – 1633) was a Welsh-born English poet, orator and Anglican priest. John Donne (1572 – 1631) was an English poet, satirist, lawyer and a cleric in the Church of England. He is considered the pre-eminent representative of the metaphysical poets.

Walton’s leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the acquaintance of Sir Henry Wotton, but it is clear that Walton had more than a love of fishing and a humorous temper to recommend him to the friendship of the accomplished ambassador. Walton completed and published the life of Donne, much to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying in 1639, Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in 1642 and published in 1651. His life of Hooker was published in 1662, that of George Herbert in 1670. All these subjects were endeared to the biographer by a certain gentleness of disposition and cheerful piety; three of them at least—Donne, Wotton and Herbert—were anglers. Their lives were evidently written with loving pains, in the same leisurely fashion as his Angler, and like it are of value less as exact knowledge than as harmonious and complete pictures of character.
