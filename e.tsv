A small town to most but known on an international scale. Just above the polar circle, at a latitude of nearly 70 degrees north with total darkness in the winter time to 24/7 daylight in the summertime, It’s seems impossible to not be inspired.

From the beginning, music was an important part of their lives and the Trance genre of house music, was from the start, the most natural choice of music for both of them.

Geir started with a collection of Trance cd´s late in the 90`s and went to local clubs to experience big names like Tiesto, Johan Gielen, Sister Bliss, DJ Lars Holte and more. All these influences have taken Geir to where he stands today - Loaded with music experience and ready to take his place in the music industry.

Espen spent several years searching the realms of House, until he finally stumbled into the trance genre and found is Heaven on Earth. Since then, Trance music has been a major part of his life and people like Armin van Buuren and Paul van Dyk inspired him most. The next natural step was DJing.

The strange thing was they never met until 2007 but quickly found out about their common interest - Trance music. During the next few years, they travelled Europe attending major Trance events. They realised that they should form a DJ duo and hit the decks themselves.

Although E&amp;G is new to the world of music, they have been releasing set mixes for many years. The mixes have been played and listened to from people from all over the world through the magic of Internet radio stations. And after that was the next step already written in the stars! So....

... in June 2010 they decided the next step would be producing. Their first track set for release was in collaboration with Aerofoil - ""Plank Effect"". With massive support from Markus Schulz and many other big names in the EDM industry - The track got fantastic response from the listeners around the globe, the official release was Oct 17 2011. Since then has releases like ""Oslo Anthem"", ""One Word"", ""Alcohol Abuse"" received wide support from Markus Schulz, Armin Van Buuren, Ferry Corsten and many more.

They are aiming for their own unique sound and are now looking to progress much quicker so more releases are promised. They also hope to gain more listeners producing and hosting their own radio show - Euphoric Sessions, which delivers the best and newest music handpicked by the guys.

Energetic, powerful, pumping sets will include mind blowing tech tracks to uplifting melodic trance tunes and they also surprise with the occasional mix in with other genres. They truly believe in giving the audience an amazing experience that leaves them with something to talk about - ALWAYS."	Norwegian DJ/Producers duo consisting of Espen Gerhardsen &amp; Geir Albertsen

The podcast series includes a set of episodes on core concepts of early childhood development which illustrate how childhood experiences shape brain development to either provide a strong foundation for lifelong health and wellbeing or confer vulnerability to disease. The early childhood development episodes also address interventions and treatments that help ensure children have the best possible start in life. The podcast series also includes a set of episodes that focus on the neurodevelopmental origins of addiction. These podcasts provide a definition of addiction as a brain disorder, and describes effective strategies to help prevent, intervene, and treat addiction. The goal of the podcast series is to give you the both the background knowledge on brain development and addiction, and the reflective skills to apply this knowledge to your practice.
The Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) created the podcast series as part of the Addiction e-Learning for Undergraduate Medical Education (UME), sponsored by the Norlien Foundation. The series is based on lectures from the Alberta Family Wellness Initiative, a knowledge mobilization initiative designed to translate scientific research into policy and practice.

EarthCore is the company with the technology, the resources and the guts to go after the mother lode. Young executive Connell Kirkland is the company's driving force, pushing himself and those around him to uncover the massive treasure.

But Kirkland and EarthCore are not the first to find this treasure. The mountain's history reveals two centuries of disappearances, murder, and insanity.

The discovery of ancient platinum knives, razor-sharp despite lying untouched for 1,000 years, reveals evidence of an ancient culture. If the artifacts are genuine, they show a pre-historic empire that once spanned from the Southern tip of South America all the way up through the American Southwest.

Wealth and fame lie under that Utah mountain, but at three miles below the surface, where the rocks are so hot they burn bare skin, something has been waiting for centuries. Waiting ... and guarding.

Why? Because Art is an industrial saboteur. He may live in London and work for an EU telecommunications megacorp, but Art's real home is the Eastern Standard Tribe.

The comm -- instant wireless communication -- puts everyone in touch with everyone else, twenty-four hours a day. But one thing hasn't changed: the need for sleep.

And Art is working to humiliate the Greenwich Mean Tribe to the benefit of his own people.

The world of next week is overflowing with ubiquitous computing, where an idea scribbled onto one's comm can revolutionize an industry. But in a world without boundaries, nothing can be taken for granted -- not happiness, not money, and, most certainly, not love.

Which might explain why Art finds himself stranded on the roof of an insane asylum outside Boston, debating whether to push a pencil into his brain. Happiness or smarts? What's it going to be, Art?"

Bij Echt Gebeurd vertellen vertellen mensen op een klein podium mooie, bijzondere of grappige verhalen over wat ze zelf hebben meegemaakt. Het idee voor Echt Gebeurd is geïnspireerd op het Amerikaanse ‘The Moth’, maar anders dan bij The Moth leest er bij Echt Gebeurd ook elke maand iemand voor uit zijn of haar puberdagboek.

In de herfst van 2008 werd de eerste Echt Gebeurd georganiseerd in Toomler. Inmiddels zijn er ook al edities van Echt Gebeurd geweest op Lowlands, Crossing Border, Into the Great Wide Open, het IDFA en Theater Walhalla in Rotterdam.
Echt Gebeurd heeft heel verschillende vertellers – veel hebben geen podiumervaring. Daarom zijn er al veel mooie en bijzondere verhalen te horen geweest: van een politieman tijdens de kroningsrellen, van een vrouw die moest vluchten uit Iran, maar ook van een jongen die tegen wil en dank hoog op de lijst van een politieke partij terecht kwam.

Zolang mensen kunnen praten, vertellen ze elkaar verhalen, en in die zin is Echt Gebeurd verre van nieuw. Wat wel nieuw is, is dat we, omringd door tv, telefoon, internet, radio, en film ontwend zijn om gewoon te luisteren naar iemand die gewoon een verhaal vertelt.
Echt Gebeurd houdt het midden tussen theater,en de verhalen die je elkaar vertelt na een lekkere maaltijd. Onze vertellers vertellen uit het hoofd, dus zonder aantekeningen of uit hun hoofd geleerde teksten."

Starring comedian Andrew Heaton economist Steven Horwitz and professor of literature Paul Cantor, EconPop takes a surprisingly deep look at the economic themes  running through classic films, new releases, tv shows and more from the best of pop culture and entertainment. The EconPop Podcast brings a unique mix of dry wit and whimsy to bear on the dismal science of economics and the result is always entertaining, educational and irreverent. It’s Econ 101 meets At The Movies, with a dash of Monty Python.

New episodes of EconPop, the world’s first and best econ-themed pop culture review show, will be released every other week on iTunes and EconStories.tv along with the YouTube Show, which is like this podcast, only shorter and with moving pictures. Don’t miss a single episode, or Adam Smith will haunt your dreams!"	EconPop is the show that sifts through the haystack of popular culture to find the needle of economics within... and then stabs you with it! Hosted by comedian Andrew Heaton, with economist Steven Horwitz and professor of literature Paul Cantor.

The rise of the label has been something of a phenomenon, with its artists touring worldwide with DJ and/or live performances at sold out venues, each appearance always long awaited and celebrated like the coming of the messiah by thousands of kids from each and every part of the world.

Drawing on the street energy of hip hop, rock’s explosion and the hypnotic compression of techno music, but remaining open to all other influences, the sound of the label, mostly electronic and saturated, has become a trademark, registered worldwide. The revered roster and SO:ME’s post-cartoon imaging are practically pop culture icons, especially within the world of new media (blogs, forums, social networks) where Ed Banger remains at the top of their game."

Accompanied by his wife, he begins a search across three continents for his brother’s killer. His hunt takes him into a trap where he, like his brother before him, becomes caught in the middle of the struggle between the pre-Al Qaeda fundamentalist Saudis and the more liberal ones who lean toward the West. His quest forces him to loose his innocence, and to face things about his country, his brother and his wife that he would prefer not to know.

Her branches reach for the stars.  She is like all other trees on planet Earth save for her enormous size. Still, she has leaves and she has bark. She turns sunlight into life. But this tree does not sprout from the dirt. Eden fills the sky, high in orbit above the blue expanse of Uranus.  There she changes humanity's very concept of extraterrestrial life. Dr. Malcolm Green is sent to Eden to audit a science team studying this extraordinary tree from the dark confines of space station Lola. But with unexplainable accidents plaguing the team, tensions are mounting between scientists and custodial staff. Is there a future for this project and Lola?  Only Malcolm Green can make that call. From the second he sets foot on Lola, Malcolm’s own future becomes at stake.  He soon finds that love, friendship, and his own mortality tremble like a leaf at the sound of Eden's call.

These stories tell us one thing over and over again – that while the process of changing systems is slow and complex and ridden with contradictions – inequality and injustice cannot prevail. “The revolution” as the African-American poet Gil Scott Heron puts it “will not be televised… the revolution is live.”"	The Education for Social Justice Podcast series is a project of the Seminar in Comparative Education course at Colgate University in Fall 2009.

NEW WORLD ORDERS, A NOVEL - 
In the nineteen-sixties, a group of wealthy men concludes that it's already too late to stop global warming from destroying the planet. But they have a plan to save themselves.

Twenty years later, Jack Crowley and Jim Patterson stumble onto the conspiracy, and every answer they find is accompanied by more questions - and more deaths. 

Jack is a former idealist, turned cynical by his years working as a New York tabloid editor. But his enthusiasm returns as he looks into the work of a NASA scientist who tells Jack about cover-ups at the space agency.  Jim is a detective with little patience for conspiracy nuts.  But he hates loose ends, and is unable to let go of the inconsistencies in another suspicious NASA death.  Soon, his investigation leads him to Jack, and they join forces. 

As Jack and Jim dig deeper, they are targeted by the type of killers that don't usually miss. From Washington to Las Vegas to the Middle East, they manage to stay one step ahead of their pursuers in a race to expose the truth, and maybe, just maybe, save the world."

He does this by venturing unseen into Windsor Forest at night to trap the love-fay, Eda, who, once spellbound, must reveal all and let him remotely view Aura's activities by means of a magic mirror cut from crystal. 

In addition to this early form of cyberstalking, Edwy, on his night-journey into the forest gets to witness a royal procession of the Fairie Queen, followed by midnight revels of elves and spirits. What seems like a mid-summer night's dream turns into a comedy of errors, though, as Edwy suffers memory loss, makes a false start, and unintentionally looses a mischievous wood sprite in the course of his romantic quest.

That&apos;s what it&apos;s like when you come face to face with authentic worship.

&quot;EE-Taow&quot; is a phrase originating from Papua New Guinea when a whole people (The Mouk) discovered the Living God at the same time. Thanks to the dedicated missionary who served these people we know it&apos;s meaning: &quot;It is TRUE. It is REAL.&quot; A cry that goes far beyond Papua New Guinea, it is the cry of every heart meeting it&apos;s creator-Jesus Christ.

For years the founders of EE-Taow Records have produced live events where worship has changed lives and brought people into the presence of God in a genuine way. It&apos;s not just something from the stage that&apos;s manipulative and it&apos;s not a concert thing. It&apos;s everybody with all their hearts poured out to God.

The heart behind EE-Taow is to take that spirit, that passion, of young people crying out to God, worshiping and singing with their heart to the creator of the universe--and get it on tape, put it on a CD, send it through downloads, and let the masses experience what hundreds of thousands have experienced, year after year at these live events called: Acquire the Fire.

The VOICE of EE-Taow Records is uncompromising. It is worshipful and reflective.... It is inspired and genuine... it is TRUE. It is REAL. The artists who record for EE-Taow are young, and they write songs for their generation. They have a gifting to lead others in worship and singing to God. We&apos;re saying to them: YOU write the songs for your generation. We want these artists to sing to God with all their hearts... not some pre-fab, over produced pop tunes, but music that invites those who hear it to experience God in a way that is deeply moving and connective.

&quot;Worship Music&quot; as we know it has a new sound. It&apos;s not the old-school organ you might be used to, its an experience born of real lives, real passion, and real relationships with a real God-Jesus Christ.

They guys behind the Label:
Ron Luce-President and founder of Teen Mania Ministries, Battle Cry, Acquire the Fire and now EE-Taow Records!

De kille Scrooge en de geest van diens vroegere kompaan Marley, de hardwerkende Cratchit, de goedlachse neef Fred, Tiny Tim en de geesten van heden, verleden en toekomst. Allemaal bleken ze een opvallend goed lijkend evenbeeld te hebben in het Apple-universum en komen ze terug in deze bewerking van Dickens’ beroemde kerstverhaal.

Stick to the main stretch for souvenirs or stray into the smaller alleys to discover hidden treasures in gold and silver, copper and leather. Fine Egyptian rugs and vibrant clothes are infused with the scent of sweet perfume and pungent spices from neighbouring stalls. Luxor has its own street markets in the old town that stay open well into the night. Narrow streets are crammed with stalls and shops selling everything from bespoke jewellery to woven goods.

Sure, I enjoy myself when I visit someone else's site. But when I create, it’s different. I have to internalize it and make it mine. Not only do I almost always learn something, I end up with something tangible to show for my effort. The joy this has given me seems more lasting and genuine. 

So why do I blog and podcast? First and foremost is the creative angle of it. I enjoy writing, creating the music and just putting the whole thing together. My original intent was to create a site that reflected my dozens of creative and recreational interests. I think I've done that to a certain extent, but it has been more subtle than I originally intended. 

I do all the graphic design, writing, photography, programming, recording, editing, instruments and so on. It seems to be the one place I can focus my unwillingness to focus--if that makes any sense. The technical challenge is part of it too, I suppose. 

The volume of intelligent and sincere praise from the people that continue to visit the site have been icing on the cake. I love that I’m generally understood, and that being logical doesn’t make me the last of a dying breed. 

Mormonism has often been the focus of my work here because for so much of my life that's all I've known. Even so, I'd like the podcast to grow to address issues with other religions, quackery and hocus-pocus. That's where I'm really excited. I hope that I'll be able to get some good interviews in the future that will help me to grow in knowledge of the world around me. 

I truly believe that we're at a critical point in history where clear thought finally has a decent shot at suppressing the irrational. I hope I'm right about that."	Bottled 1970. Corked 1978. Screwed ever since.

&#13;
Brad Friedman:&#13;
&#13;
The recount of the election for Wisconsin Supreme Court seat between Joanne Kloppenburg and incumbent David Prosser has ended with Prosser said to be some 7000 votes ahead.  Kloppenburg has until Monday, May 30 to challenge recount, and to be successful, would have to show that at least half that number should be removed due to irregularities.  &#13;
&#13;
The hard-fought, closely watched election and recount revealed a fatally flawed election system in Wisconsin, with poor procedures, a broken chain of custody for ballots, and apparently incompetent election officials from top to bottom.  &#13;
&#13;
It's up to Kloppenburg whether she wants to pursue the challenge, and Velvet Revolution and others have been trying to convince her to do it - if not for her own election, then to draw attention and energy towards election reform in Wisconsin.  With vital recall elections coming up for Republican henchman of Scott Walker, it's imperative that citizens get on the case.&#13;
&#13;
Emily Levy:&#13;
&#13;
Emily is asking for about 30 volunteers to read the official &quot;minutes&quot; of the recount in Wisconsin's 72 counties and record irregularities into an online spreadsheet in order to make the case for the challenge.  We'll see what we can do.&#13;
&#13;
We took a quick moment to mention the multi-state Republican voter suppression campaign of passing bills in state legislatures to require voters to provide photo ID at the polls, etc. - also reported at Brad Blog.&#13;

He knows who he's looking for, he's seen him on the cover of the NME. Drawn across oceans by fame and fate, Aston is keeping his diary empty to make sure he's available.

When a virtual stranger calls Aston a few hours before his death, fate catches up with him, derailing his barely-made plans. Amid a hundred boozy evenings and romantic deadends, a mystery unfurls.

Equally assisted and hindered by tremulous accountant Tom Hensley and dedicated loafer Steven Black, Aston uncovers a different London, one of murder, ghosts, dangerous emails and the second big bang.

As chaotic and random as the city it inhabits, Electricity gradually evolves into a mystery bigger than the universe itself. Being of a somewhat useless persuasion, Aston does his best to ignore it.

Après une rencontre avec Thierry Luxman (fondateur de TL ORGANISATION), c'est parti pour deux années complètes à ses côtés pour lancer cette entreprise qui est maintenant N°1 dans le Poitou-Charentes dans l'organisation de soirées (Mariages, Soirées Etudiantes, Soirées Mousse / Neige / CO2, ...), ce qui lui a permis d'acquérir une vraie expérience ainsi qu'un savoir faire.

Fin 2009, c'est le départ pour une région plus active, il arrive à Nantes où il stoppa ses platines. Un an plus tard, la musique le rattrapant, il décide de rallumer ses platines en se consacrant à son style musical, la musique électronique.

C'est en été 2011 qu'il lance son podcast, c'est alors que plusieurs personnes du milieu (DJ, Label, Bar & Clubs, WebRadio, ...) le remarque.

Miss Phem’s, jeune femme de 27 ans, est arrivée dans le monde de la musique il y a près de 4ans. Elle arrive du Sud-Ouest de la France, près de Toulouse. Elle joue principalement, du Latin-house, l’électro et Electro-house. Très inspirée par Dj Tiesto, et Armin Van Buren, elle va se lancer doucement dans la Trance. Elle aimerait plus tard se lancer dans la production. 
Tout à commencer en Octobre 2010 dans un jeu de réalité virtuel, vous allez peut-être en rire, mais c’est bien là qu'elle a mixé pour la première fois. 
Petit à petit son désir d'évolution l'amena à travailler sur des CDJ 850, et un an après s'inscrit au concours She Can Dj, Bien loin du niveau des professionnelles, et sujette aux critiques elle continua la tête haute et prit des cours de mix auprès de l'association Monte le Son avec Culture Mix. 
Aujourd'hui elle a signé pour une résidence dans un bar cabaret sur Agen, Le Take Off Bar Lounge, où elle continue de progresser du mercredi au samedi soir sur des Cdj 2000 nexus ."	"Suivez la sur facebook

Tastemaker support for their sound from the likes of Pete Tong, Steve Smart, Skream and Benga, Jamie Jones, Maceo Plex, Claude Von Stroke, Luca C, & Mark Knight compounds the output of their own productions released on Sexy Trash Digital; the imprint started by Electronic Youth to showcase their take on “house” with 80's electro and early house influences, deep bass lines and tuff beats, all aligned with a veneer of urban vocal.

Topping things off are their DJ performances, with recent UK sets for Loco Dice @ Electric Brixton, Def Mix 25th Anniversary & Stealth (both Ministry of Sound) along with their long standing “Random” residency, and a calendar populated with summer gigs including UK’s High Definition Festival (pre party), Stealth and Kinky Malinki @ Ministry of Sound, SW4 Festival (after party), and Ibiza 2013 sets at both Eden and Booom!

The new single “I Would Leave” featuring London vocalist and Goldsmiths University graduate Shanaz Dorsett is about to drop with tastemakers in November ahead of late January release.

That’s now, but how about “then”...

The duo that is Electronic Youth comprises LeisureGroove & Rustem Rustem.

Rustem moved through an early career in vinyl distribution whilst helming his own Loonacy & Spud Records imprints, adding a spell in charge of The Hoxton Whores own WhoreHouse Records. 

LeisureGroove created a solo production career with success and support from the likes of Judge Jules, and Seb Fontaine via his own label Digital Disco Records collaborating with the likes of Angie Brown, and seeing successful release with the likes of Hed Kandi.

The two then hooked up on the UK DJ circuit, and created Sexy Trash Digital with initial releases on the label including 'Rat Race' and 'People' under their own names.

A change of direction in sound took place reflecting their joint desire to create something new and fresh, reflecting their musical influences combined with the “deep” sound emerging from London and the South East ...Electronic Youth was born!

This is where it gets a little hectic...

An EP signed to Sander Kleinenberg's label THIS IS Records kicks things off. New York label System Recordings releases the 'Life On Mars EP', Sexy Trash Digital' re-launches with self-produced EP's and output from signed artists including Subk0de & Sebastian Klone. Electronic Youth create remixes for MYNC ( getting their own single released on CR2 Records as a result), and two very large “unofficial” remixes namely Kariya’s “Let Me Love You For Tonight” and Angie Stone’s “Wish I Didn’t Miss You”.

In addition scan the listings on the likes of Beatport and Traxsource and you’ll find Electronic Youth’s production work curated by the likes of Maquina Music, PHD Recordings, Stealth Records and Conkrete Digital with further releases due on their own Sexy Trash Digital label which relaunches at the end of 2013.

Step forward to 2014 and the release of Electronic Youth’s debut album beckons preceded by “I Would Leave” and another single featuring Mos Eisley “Dreams.

Squeezing a decade of personal dance experiences and a lifetime of musical influences into one long player ain’t gonna be easy, but when “The Youth” are on their watch you know it’s going to be something big!

Pop a note in your musical calendar...................meantime they’ll see you on the dancefloor!"	Electronic Youth - Supplying you the best in upfront Electronic Music, mixed and Engineered by Leisuregroove &amp; Rustem Rustem

Among its artists are some leading lights of modern Russian electronic music. The people at Electronica are also on good terms with practically all the important representatives of Moscow’s club and techno scenes, too. They put out podcasts, releases, and manage all manner of events. The Electronica project is a wonderful example of how digital technology can bring together people who live in different time zones and, we must admit, very different cities.

The history of the label dates back to the eponymous radio show, which opened on FM-waves of a small Siberian town from October 12, 2007. The main idea of this show was – talk about music, which is not often you can hear every day, in the confusion of life of small towns and their outskirts. Periodically during the show you could hear guest mixes from the representatives of different cities, labels Russia and CIS.

1 May 2008 published the first online release of “Electronica” in support of the radio show, which at that time had already been actively discussed in the network published podcasts.Releases began to come out every month, gradually picking up their number of listeners and the number of artists – now they have more than 50! Among them: Audiodump, Adverb, Alla Farmer, Alex Danilov, Combinator, Clapan, Ryba, Doyeq, Eric Delay, Frunk29, Sergey Suokas, Imachi Akira, Kammerton, Killahertz, Korablove, Lazzich, Masha Era, Modul, Milinal, Nikosf., Okcug, Polar Lights, Sanderson, Vadim Lankov, Waveform, Yuka …"	From Siberia with Love...

However, there are a few notable songs by Kaimbr & Oddisee that we don't believe ever saw the light of day after this mixtape.  Hope you enjoy this mix.

Theosophy comes from the ancient wisdom that man and nature are as inseparable from the universe as the universe is inseparable from man and nature. It is a science and a philosophy, not a religion which depends on (dogma) faith. Knowledge gained through the study of Theosophy comes from the understanding of natural laws and harmony of the universe. Rogers shows us why we cannot separate ourselves from God (universe); the evolution of the soul; rebirth after physical death; why we don’t remember past lives and much more. If you’ve ever questioned why we are here or what happens when we die, the study of Theosophy may provide answers.

Classes range from strong beginners to advanced. They are 1hr or 1hr and 15 min.  Depending on the level and length of the individual class they may include all or some of the following: a theme, meditation, pranayama, warm ups, sun salutations, standing poses, arm balances, hip openers, thigh stretches, backbends, forward bends, cool down poses and relaxation.  Remember, the class is live and Elsie is teaching to what she sees. It's designed to include you into the class experience, to participate in deeper ways.  This is not a ""flow"" or ""power yoga"" class.  It includes power and flow, but more emphasis on alignment.  You never know what's coming but it always proves to be a blast!

With over 13 years in Bangkok Thailand, Emanuel Skinner has become a household name and a house music icon locally and abroad. Originally from San Francisco and now a Phuket local sharing his vision and sound all across South East Asia . With over 20 years experience filling the best and biggest venues from Jakarta, Singapore, China, India, to South Korea, Bangladesh to Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and all over Thailand (Chang Mai, Koh Tao, Koh Samui, Phuket, Pattaya, Koh Panghan etc...) plus his residencies at San Francisco&#8217;s best rave&#8217;s and nightclubs in in the early 90&#8217;s.


Emanuel Skinner began his obsession with music from the days of vinyl. Collecting and playing funk, disco, old school hip hop, and dub reggae vinyl way back in 1987. With what started as just a hobby playing at friend&#8217;s birthdays, school dances and block parties on weekends grew into a full time profession. 10 years later in college he moved in with local legendary deep house master Miguel Migs before he got signed to Naked Music, Transport, Zebra, NRK records etc... in the early days of electronic music.

The first time he heard house music he instantly knew he had to be a part of it!
He got his first residency at a small venue named &#8216;Skunk lounge&#8217; with Old School Graffitti artist Razor and &#8216;Groove lounge&#8217; with long time college friend Miguel Migs warming up for local DJs, organizing parties in random locations around the Bay Area and throwing his own parties. Some DJs he was very fortunate to spin with incl. Miguel Migs, Rick Preston, Jon Howard, Chris Lum, David Harness, DJ Rasoul, Dubtribe and other greats at the time. 

His penchant for rhythmic complexity, organic machine made beats and stripped down vocals proves Emanuel has the experience and is a natural behind the decks, working the dance floor week after week, year after year. His strong desire to share great new music with the world drives him to be one step ahead of the hottest trends in underground dance music, which ensures that his sets are always full of the latest club tracks plus some classics thrown in for good measure.

Over the years he has also collaborated with some very talented performers, singers, dancers, sax players and percussionists on stage. Thailand&#8217;s most recognized and talented percussionist Num (T-Bone) and Emanuel have been playing together for over 9 yrs.
His weekly residency 'Models night' is Bangkok&#8217;s first &amp; longest running most successful Wednesday night in the city. It was the most talked about night in and around Asia and abroad not just for the jet setting models but for providing Bangkok with quality dance music unheard anywhere else at the time.  He has graced the decks with the worlds best DJ/Artists from around the world, DJ Roog, Kid Massive, Robert Owens, Rasmus Faber, Felix the Housecat, Dennis Ferrer, Martin Solvieg, DJ Gregory, Johnny Fiasco, Copyright, Knee Deep, Ian Carey, Oliver Lang, Born 2 Funk, Felix the Housecat, Nicky Siano, Layo and Bushwacka, Joey Negro, Oliver Lang, Laurent Garnier, Armin Van Buuren, AVIICI, Laidback Luke, Kevin Hedges of Blaze, Raul Rincon, Jesse Garcia, Sandy rivera, Bodyrox, Derrick Carter, DJ Pierre, Miguel Migs, Tocodisco and many more.

After falling in love at first sight, Emily's mind was opened to the harsh realities brought about by the worldwide alliances between vampires and humanity at every level of society. Nicholas was leading the charge in the fight against injustice, cruelty, slavery, and tyranny by the elder vampires, and Emily found herself suddenly caught up in a movement that stood for the rights of both humanity and a new generation of vampires who'd been tricked into giving up their natural rights.

Doing everything she can for the cause comes second only to following her heart as Emily tries to win the affections of a young man whose first priority is saving the world. She follows Nicholas back and forth across the country, into the heart of the nation's vampire-run Capitol, and beyond. She risks her health, sticks out her neck, sacrifices friendship, and puts her life on the line in the name of love. Will her efforts be enough? Will she win Nicholas' heart? Can they save the world? Or will the schemes of the elder vampires put a stop to it all?

Emily is one of two books in the duology Never Let the Right One Go, which shows two apparently conflicting views of the same supernatural world by looking through the eyes of two very different teenage girls in their pursuit of love. Don't miss Sophia, the other half of the picture, and a completely contrary take on everything you think you know."

Emission basée sur l'engagement et la solidarité
Dans le but d'informer et sensibiliser les auditeurs sur des sujets de société ou des sujets sensibles qui concernent la vie de tous les jours, mais des sujets qui ne sont pas forcement traités d'une maniere profonde par les medias. 
L'autre but est de dire ce que l'on pense sans langue de bois et tout en restant naturel.

Notre emission lutte contre toutes les formes de discriminations (racisme, homophobie, misere, politique, santé, handicap, etc...)
Nous vous proposons egalement des emissions speciales sur les grandes journées et grands evenements de l'annee (comme le telethon, journee contre le sida, journee contre la misere etc...)

Notre emission etant associative, nous ne sommes que des amateurs, mais nous sommes surtout des battants et des militants, nous sommes tout simplement des gens ordinaires qui s'expriment le plus naturellement possible, en luttant pour la bonne cause. Nous souhaitons egalement demontrer qu'il n'y a pas besoin d'etre des pros dans les radios ou des journalistes pros dans les medias, pour dire ce que l'on pense ou nous exprimer librement sur des sujets sensibles.

He has larger concerns on his mind. He is swept into the hidden underground of Midgard, once the shining jewel of enlightenment and technology. The city is regressing back to an unenlightened and viscous age following the end of the world in the Cataclysm.

All that remains is a corrupt governor and self-proclaimed god who rules all with an iron fist, a religious cult planning to dismantle society, and a rebel army who fights against Governor Fredrick. As Alan is pulled into the fighting, he finds it hard to discern friend from foe while desperately trying to find his place in the remnants of society. But when he discovers the secrets behind the Cataclysm, it becomes a struggle to save humanity from itself.

A nontraditional epic fantasy mixed with post-apocalyptic science fiction, this is not the first book of a long, unending series, but a standalone story that possesses everything necessary to enjoy the adventure. It does not contain many of the normal fantasy or science fiction tropes either, leaving this story unique in a field where each book on the surface appears to be the same as the ones before. Endospore is something special, a story unlike any other."	Alan is a virgin, but that is not a big problem for him with Tracy and Gwinn desiring his attentions. He has larger concerns on his mind.

Happy house music for Happy people!

Hello to you all energised house lovers and welcome! 
  
I am and always have been passionate about music, and to my sins, spent (and still do) a lot of weekends in clubs. 
I love to dance &amp; play good uplifting house music but it becomes rare in clubs these days.

Mostly I love to see when people really enjoy dancing and they always get excited with when the music is high and energetic.

Playing energised progressive house has this effect as it puts a big smile and joy to clubbers &#8211; and hands in the air! 
  
I hope you enjoy listening (and dancing) to my mixes as much as I enjoy mix them&#8230;

If you do like the music please become my followers so you sure to get informed when new mixes are published

Always looking to play live to happy crowd so let me know when and where....

Soon in a party near you... :-)

Put them high!"	Happy house music for Happy people

Dr. Michael Webber, Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering, approached the FIC to help create a new program in which students could successfully produce a podcast from start to finish. Students in Dr. Webber’s “Energy, Technology &amp; Policy” course were given the option of creating a podcast in lieu of writing a final research paper, and were strongly encouraged to use this new media format to produce short PSAs that focused on various energy issues. The FIC commissioned an Apple iMac to be a “Podcast Station,” on which students could edit media with or without supervision from FIC staff. Likewise, UT Apple Student Campus Representatives played a key role during this project by helping the FIC demonstrate how to edit audio and video during group training sessions, and were also available for one-to-one sessions throughout the production process. Consumer software applications iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand were prevalently used, with additional utilization of Keynote, PowerPoint, and Windows Movie Maker. This project was the first large-scale initiative of its kind at the University of Texas in which students are the creators of course podcasts. -- http://www.fic.engr.utexas.edu --

""So I started immediately buying old stuff. I had built out my tool set and component set enough and felt comfortable enough doing it that the next step was to go into building modular synth components."" This is the garage of a man who's branched out. Its interiors echo the outside of the suburban Philadelphia home he shares with his family next door, those front lawn childhood playsets traded in for the toys of one of the most successful and diverse indie music producers around. There's recording equipment, a slew of live instruments, including two drum sets and synths of all stripes, plus a number of self-assembled musical components in various states of disarray.

Krohn, a micromanager of sorts, has happily injected himself in nearly every aspect of the music creation process, from production, to vocals, to live instruments to running his own record. Building his own equipment was, naturally, the next logical step. Among other things, the components assembled on his workbench lend an air of uncertainty that has driven his compositions and recordings over the years. ""I never know what things are going to sound like until I finish them,"" he says. ""Having an idea and exploring that idea as you're recording it is very exciting to me. That excitement pushes you and inspires you to put more time into a thing and really get every minute component of it right. And that is enormously satisfying."""

Sharing wisdom is a big concept but it can be expressed through even the smallest actions and is built on four core values: inclusion, appreciation, respect and self-esteem.  Our mission is to advocate, educate and research on a wide array of topics, causes and issues relevant to aging and aging-care in the Atlantic Region. It’s this sharing wisdom piece that we hope to highlight in our new podcast series which launched in September 2013.

We’re developing and delivering a bi-monthly, half-hour podcast that touches upon a wide variety of aging related topics, that fit within the five strategic areas of focus that guide how we can achieve our mission: Wellbeing, Life-long Learning, Financial Recognition, Employer Support and Long-Term Care.

If you have any topics you’d like us to cover, or if you’d like to be interviewed, please let us know.

Daily, the watery grave kept him half-alive half-dead.  Prison implants hooked up his mind to prison machines leaving his body limp and lifeless for hours on end.  When he reagained control of his body, the only sign of outside life in the Tank had been the dim blue light filtering in through the rippling surface of the water.  Memories of his former privileged life as CTO of Citynet had become nothing more than a painful memory.  The Nanoteks he had injected into his body no longer spoke to him.  He was in the Tank because of them and they knew it.  Three years passed in the Tank, three years of self doubt and pain, time enough to contemplate what could have been.  On the door of the Tank, a clock ticked down, indicating thirteen more years to serve.  Outside the prison walls, humanity has established a strong foothold on Erstol, the artificial world on which Fowler was imprisoned.  On Erstol, aliens mix freely with humans but there is more cold ambition than understanding between the species.  Humans have managed to find power and prestige in the form of Citynet.  However one day, the clock on the Tank stops and Fowler is taken unexpectedly out of the Tank.  Nanoteks are running amok inside Citynet and will soon crash all the servers.  Fowler is given a choice.  He must discover the truth behind the Nanotek attack if he wants his life back.  Humanity on Erstol must be saved.  There is only one problem.  Those who seek his help are the ones who placed him in the Tank.  Subscribe to this audiobook on the net or iTunes.

This podcast covers a period of a little more than three-quarters of a century. We begin with the first attempt at English colonization in America, in 1576, and will end with the year 1652, when the supremacy of Parliament was recognized throughout the English colonies.

The original motive of colonization is found in English rivalry with the Spanish power; and early on in this series we'll look at how this motive influenced Gilbert and Raleigh in their endeavors to plant colonies in Newfoundland and North Carolina."

The book made its first appearance in 1890 and has remained a firm favorite with both young and old ever since.  

Fairy tales have traditionally emanated from France and Germany. The famous compilations by La Fontaine and the Brothers Grimm have overshadowed children's literature for centuries. Yet, many of the stories we recount to children today have an English origin, something that we were unaware of.  

The author, Joseph Jacobs, was an Australian folklorist and historian who painstakingly compiled them from various sources. In the preface to the first edition he recounts how he collected some stories from the descendants of English immigrants in America and Australia, while he sourced others from English gypsies and old ballads. In many cases he had to rewrite and retell those stories which existed in verse form or in ancient dialects. Older forms of English had to be tailored to suit modern readers, while some of the more objectionable parts had to be discarded. Wicked step-mothers, rampaging giants, damsels in distress, gallant princes and evil spells are some of the staples in this fascinating collection.   

The author himself states that it was his intention to create a book in which the stories would sound as if they were being narrated by an old nurse or grandmother. Hence, the style is simple, direct and like he states, meant to be read aloud and not visually. The original edition also included extensive notes on the source from which he collected the stories and reference material which is of great interest to folk-lore enthusiasts. Such was the impact of some of the stories that they are referenced in Shakespeare's plays and provided inspiration for poets like Milton.  

The highlight of the book for serious readers is the elaborate footnotes which provide a great deal of information about different variants of these stories that are told in other parts of the world. One of the most attractive features in the book are the charming illustrations that accompany each tale.  

The book is a delightful read for both parents and children. Apart from old favorites, there are many new tales which most people would not have encountered like “Nix Nought Nothing” “The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh” or “The Earl of Mar's Daughter.”"	Jack the Giant-Killer, Tom Thumb, Goldilocks and The Three Bears, Henny Penny, Dick Whittington, The Three Little Pigs, Red Riding Hood and a host of immortal characters are found in this delightful collection of English Fairy Tales by Joseph Jacobs...

In unseren „Evolutionären Dialogen“ widmen sich Katrin Karneth und Dr. Tom Steininger jedes Mal einem Aspekt der Bewusstseinsarbeit von EnlightenNext. Vor dem Hintergrund von Andrew Cohens Ansatz des Evolutionary Enlightenment  untersuchen sie gemeinsam mit den Zuhörern die Qualitäten eines neuen, evolutionären Denkens und Handelns.

Abwechselnd  dazu laden wir in unserer „Interview-Serie“ Studiogäste zum Gespräch, die selbst wichtige Beiträge zu  einer neuen, evolutionären Kultur leisten. Alle 14 Tage sprechen wir mit Menschen, die in ihrer eigenen Arbeit, sei es als Buchautor/in, als Lehrer/in, als Aktivist/in oder in einer anderen Form, eine moderne Spiritualität studieren und leben. Mit dabei waren bisher zum Beispiel Annette Kaiser, Thomas Hübl, Hans Jecklin, Johannes Heimrath, Ingo Jahrsetz u.v.a.

Im kreativen Interesse an den Perspektiven einer neuen evolutionären Weltsicht öffnen sich im Radio EnlightenNext Räume des Verstehens und der Begegnung, die uns gemeinsam zu einem bewussteren Leben inspirieren können.

Wir laden Sie herzlich ein zu erleben, mit welch erstaunlicher Lebendigkeit, Authentizität und Kraft das im virtuellen Raum eines Radio-Webcast und Telefongesprächs möglich ist."

Their appreciation of dance music goes back in to time &#8211; far beyond Detroit and Chicago.  When rhythm was still a body thing and simple drums where played with simple sticks.  They have the heart to question the overall progress.  Instead of blindly follow common trends  they create a movement of their own.  It&#8217;s the soul that counts.  Enterbt Records  Do the Snake!

Edith Heard est généticienne de formation. Elle a suivi des études en sciences naturelles à l’Université de Cambridge au Royaume-Uni et a préparé son doctorat au « Imperial Cancer Research Fund » à Londres. Edith Heard est arrivée en France, à l’Institut Pasteur en 1990. Elle dirige aujourd’hui à l’Institut Curie, l’Unité de Génétique et biologie du développement et l’équipe « Épigenèse et développement des mammifères ».

Elle a reçu de nombreuses distinctions pour ses travaux de recherche, comme la Médaille d’argent du CNRS, en 2008, le prix Jean Hamburger de la ville de Paris, en 2009, l’ERC Advanced Investigator Award du Conseil européen de la recherche en 2010 et le Grand Prix de la FRM en 2011. Elle est en outre membre élu de la prestigieuse Organisation européenne de biologie moléculaire (EMBO) depuis 2005. En 2012, elle a été nommée Professeure au Collège de France.

Edith Heard se consacre depuis plusieurs années à l’étude des processus épigénétiques, tel que l’inactivation du chromosome X chez les mammifères, un modèle classique dans ce domaine. Ses travaux ont contribué à la compréhension des premiers événements qui accompagnent l’inactivation du chromosome X au cours de l’embryogenèse. Son équipe a mis en évidence une dynamique remarquable des changements épigénétiques au cours du développement précoce et a élucidé une partie des mécanismes responsables du processus d’inactivation du X. Elle a aussi démontré la diversité de stratégies mises en œuvre dans ce processus entre des mammifères mêmes très proches au cours de l’évolution. L’ensemble de ces travaux sont largement reconnus dans le domaine, car des mécanismes similaires semblent être impliqués dans d’autres processus épigénétiques."

Kann man das nicht beschleunigen? Doch, man kann. Ab sofort können Sie immer wöchentlich die besten Ideen, Tipps und Strategien bekommen, die Ihre Verkaufsarbeit beflügeln werden. Jede Woche widmen Sie sich einem Thema und erarbeiten sich schrittweise Verbesserungen, die auch in Ihrer Praxis funktionieren.

Wenn Sie sich unter news.vertriebverkauft.de eintragen, werden Sie automatisch informiert, wie und wo Sie die einzelnen Themen finden. Dieser Podcast erscheint wöchentlich. Wenn Sie wertvolle Tipps entdeckt haben, können Sie sich dann später in Ruhe unter blog.visionselling.de den Text dazu lesen und weitere Unterlagen dazu herunterladen.

Die Reihe ist in dreizehn Kapiteln mit jeweils vier Themen gegliedert, so dass 52 Wochen abgedeckt sind. Hier finden Sie die 13 Kapitelüberschriften:

• Erfolgs-Prinzipien - Das ""große Blutbild"" zeigt schonungslos die wichtigsten Mängel Ihres Verkaufs
• Schlüssel-Aufgaben - Das ""Leistungs-EKG"" macht klar, wo Reserven in der Organisation schlummern
• Wunschkunden - Eindeutige Zielgruppe(n) als Richtwertgeber für effektiven Vertrieb
• Vertriebsstrategie - Entscheidungsverhalten der Kunden prägt Ihre Vorgehensweise
• Akquisitionsvorbereitung - So machen Sie sich attraktiv für Ihre Wunschpartner
• Akquisitionsgespräche - Statt stammeln: Zeichen setzen und glänzen
• Gesprächsführung - Echtes Verständnis als Grundlage für modernen Verkauf
• Motiv-Forschung - In Zeiten des Überangebotes müssen wir dem Nutzen ein klares Handlungsmotiv zur Seite stellen
• Nicht-Präsentation - Die Alternative zu „Mein Haus, mein Boot, mein Auto,…""
• Entscheidungsverständnis - So helfen Sie Ihrem Kunden über die Schlucht des Entscheidungsflimmerns
• Effektive Angebote - So kommen sie öfter und schneller zum ""Ja, ich will!""
• Verhandlungsführung - Immun gegen Verhandlungstricks und Einkäufer-Manipulation
• (Selbst-)Führung im Vertrieb - Controlling statt unnötige Kontrolle und klare Aussagen zur Vertriebsleistung"	B2B Vertrieb mit Herz und Hirn

In the past few years though, Copeland began retooling some older songs he had written for other artists (My Steps Are Ordered, Come to Me), new takes on classic hymns (Softly and Tenderly, Just As I Am), polishing up a few he had previously released (Have Thine Own Way), and writing new tunes that defined his current place in life (In Between Dreams, On the Side).

The fields are flooded, the bridges crumble and the increasingly isolated town is host to a serial killer with a grudge against the wealthy Lollo family. Slipping between a small cast of characters; the killer, the tortured policeman hiding a dark secret, the returning son, the inquisitive librarian, the boy caught between cultures.... each of these marred, struggling humans a part of the threadbare fabric of the town. Throughout the story, secrets and motivations are slowly revealed, people continue to die, and it continues to rain. - Emily from POD People

The story is about a Native American, driven to madness by his experience growing up in the small upstate New York town of Canyon Park being discriminated, molested and ostracized. In his mind, various characters of his tribe's mythology and American popular culture vie for his soul. He terrorizes the residents of Canyon Park, murdering those he judges guilty, to punish them for their crimes against him and his ancestors. Strangely, since the killing spree began, there has been a deluge of constant rain adding to the dismal mood and hampering efforts to stop him while the resident also battle nature's fury. Under these conditions, various characters gather from places as close as the local library, to as far away as New York City, to absolve their sins and stop their beloved town from being eroded away.

All the characters are eventually stripped bare in this trying time and face their naked souls, their dark inner parts that they are afraid to see and their true selves. America's national guilt over the destruction of the Native American culture is weaved through the motivation of the characters as they struggle with the consequences of acts they committed in the past or the acts of their kin.

The Indian Boarding Schools and the Mythology of Iroquois Creation Myth were thoroughly researched and are based on fact though the setting and characters are all fictional. 

Thanks Tom Cote for his version of Amazing Grace in my last chapter."	Canyon Park is bowed down under a relentless torrent of rain.

Charles McCarthy's Behold the Lamb, masterfully and beautifully translated and recorded into Spanish by Dr. Manuel Soto-Viera.

Behold The Lamb y su traducción al español, Ese es el Cordero, son propiedad intelectual de Dios.  Dios es verdad, fuente de toda verdad, y desea que sus criaturas—a quienes dio la capacidad de conocer la Verdad—conozcan la Verdad.  Todo cuanto es verdad pertenece a Dios, y también, mediante Dios, a la humanidad.  La Verdad es un regalo de amor (ágape) para todos nosotros, los seres humanos.  Solamente se le considera propiedad privada, y no la propiedad en común de toda la humanidad (por ser fruto del esfuerzo de todos los seres humanos), cuando la secuestran personas violentas, codiciosas y egoístas para dominarla y con ello aumentar su poder y su riqueza a expensas de sus hermanos y hermanas —y a expensas también del Plan Divino de su Padre Eterno.  Objetivamente, la única propiedad privada es el error.  La Verdad es, esencialmente, universal.  Nosotros—Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, el autor humano de estas conferencias, y Manuel E. Soto Viera, su traductor humano al español—con gozo y entusiasmo te damos Ese es el Cordero a ti, lector, para cualquier verdad que estas conferencias te traigan desde la Eternidad en pro del bien temporal y eterno de todas las gentes."

Cundiff	CundiffWJ@hotmail.com	""	CundiffWJ@hotmail.com		"FOR more than six hundred years that is, since Magna Carta, in 1215 there has been no clearer principle of English or American constitutional law, than that, in criminal cases, it is not only the right and duty of juries to judge what are the facts, what is the law, and what was the moral intent of the accused; but that it is also their right, and their primary and paramount duty, to judge of the justice of the law, and to hold all laws invalid, that are, in their opinion, unjust or oppressive, and all persons guiltless in violating, or resisting the execution of, such laws.

So begins Spooner's epic on the jury, its origins and history. Spooner examines the history and powers of a jury, from the magna carta in King John's time, to the practices in the 18th century. A classic work on law, Spooner argues that the decision of the jury is sovereign over the king's law. (Summary by Bethanne)"	Essays and Short Works, History , Political Science

Habitu&#233; des plateaux de t&#233;l&#233;vision, coqueluche des m&#233;dias, Malek Chebel est aussi un grand format intellectuel puisque, non content d&#8217;&#234;tre historien et anthropologue, il est &#233;galement psychanalyste. Il y a pr&#232;s de 10 ans, il publiait un livre qui allait conna&#238;tre un grand succ&#232;s : &quot; Manifeste pour un islam des lumi&#232;res &quot;. Il y jetait les bases de sa vision d&#8217;un monde musulman s&#8217;engageant sur la voie d&#8217;une &quot; r&#233;formation &quot; comparable &#224; celle qu&#8217;a connu le monde chr&#233;tien au XVIe si&#232;cle : s&#233;paration du civil et du religieux, autonomie du sujet et r&#233;&#233;valutation du statut du prescrit coranique et de la tradition interpr&#233;tative.

Electronic music – whether it&apos;s  techno, tech house, house music, progressive house, breaks, chill – has had a huge impact on my life. It is very emotional to me.

Devant l’échec de l’universalisme, qu’il s’agisse du marché, des droits de l’homme, de l’environnement ou du droit pénal,   la tentation est de revenir à la conception traditionnelle du droit identifié à l’État. Mais face à la globalisation des flux (flux financiers et flux d’information), des risques (écologiques, sanitaires ou biotechnologiques) et des crimes (de la corruption au terrorisme), la réponse ne peut se limiter au droit national. D’où la recherche des conditions d’une internationalisation pluraliste qui ne renonce pas à la diversité des systèmes mais apprend à les ordonner autour de principes communs.

The internationalization of law, the central topic of the Chair of Legal Studies, is not a category like domestic or international law, but a movement that transforms one by the other, or one into the other, and creates tension between relativism and universalism. Considering universalism’s failure (in the areas of the market, human rights, environmental law and criminal law), it would seem reasonable to prefer the traditional conception of law identified with the state. But domestic law cannot by itself cope with the globalization of flows (of money and information), risks (ecological, sanitary and biotechnological), or crimes (from corruption to terrorism). This is why the Chair’s research into how to realize pluralist internationalization focuses on accepting diversity and finding ways to organize the various systems around common principles.

Chesterton explains his book rather well in his introduction, but it might help to start with a sense of the time in question. Chesterton started work on Eugenics and Other Evils in about 1910, but it was not completed and published until 1922. In his own introduction he talks about the period before and after ""The War."" The war he refers to is now called World War One.

We now have a distaste for the word Eugenics, largely driven by events in World War Two. But at the time this book was published, Eugenics was lauded to the skies as a wonderful idea, and Chesterton was nearly the only person saying in writing that Eugenics was in fact evil. A case could be made, and has been made, that today, though the word Eugenics is avoided, some practices that are in fact Eugenic practices, and some sciences that are in fact Eugenic sciences, enjoy great popularity and engender great public enthusiasm. To which practices and which sciences I refer, is left as an exercise for the reader.

""Though most of the conclusions, especially towards the end, are conceived with reference to recent events, the actual bulk of preliminary notes about the science of Eugenics were written before the war. It was a time when this theme was the topic of the hour; when eugenic babies (not visibly very distinguishable from other babies) sprawled all over the illustrated papers; when the evolutionary fancy of Nietzsche was the new cry among the intellectuals; and when Mr. Bernard Shaw and others were considering the idea that to breed a man like a cart-horse was the true way to attain that higher civilisation, of intellectual magnanimity and sympathetic insight, which may be found in cart-horses. It may therefore appear that I took the opinion too controversially, and it seems to me that I sometimes took it too seriously. But the criticism of Eugenics soon expanded of itself into a more general criticism of a modern craze for scientific officialism and strict social organisation.""

The book is still controversial, and many people with many different political agendas point to ""Eugenics"" as backing up whatever claims they make.  In any case, a remarkable number of comments and observations by Chesterton, on a wide variety of topics, could have been written last week.  It was worth producing, and I think you'll find it worth reading."	I think G.K.

For many years almost every school child studied this poem during the middle school years. Although the decline of the reputation of the once-idolized poet has also brought neglect to this classic, it is still a very touching and expertly written work of art. It is based upon the tragic expulsion of the French settlers from Acadia (located in the Canadian maritime provinces) during the French & Indian War (1754-1763). Many Acadians died as a result of their exile, and many families were separated, including the heroine of this poem and her betrothed.

It is written in the style of a diary kept by the first woman in the Judeao-Christian creation myth, Eve, and is claimed to be ""translated from the original MS."" The ""plot"" of this novel is the first-person account of Eve from her creation up to her burial by, her mate, Adam, including meeting and getting to know Adam, and exploring the world around her, Eden. The story then jumps 40 years into the future after the Fall and expulsion from Eden. It is one of a series of books Twain wrote concerning the story of Adam and Eve, including 'Extracts from Adam's Diary,' 'That Day In Eden,' 'Eve Speaks,' 'Adam's Soliloquy,' and the 'Autobiography of Eve.' Eve's Diary has a lighter tone than the others in the series, as Eve has a strong appreciation for beauty and love. The book may have been written as a posthumous love-letter to Mark Twain's wife Olivia Langdon Clemens, or Livy, who died in June 1904, just before the story was written. Mark Twain is quoted as saying, ""Eve's Diary is finished — I've been waiting for her to speak, but she doesn't say anything more.""

Martin Luther King Jr. thought love is the most durable power in the world. Bruce Lee suggested love is like a friendship caught on fire. Some say love conquers all. Other say love is forever. 

We have no clue what love is.

What we do know is love creates ex's: ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends, ex-husbands, ex-wives, ""ex""-cetera. Love is the Charles Francis Xavier of generations of ex-men and ex-women.

In Pakistan, sectarian strife kicked off in 80s under the Zia regime. To resolve the issue of radicalism, first we need to fix who is responsible for aiding and abetting terrorism. Our past governments sponsored terrorist outfits. Why is the govt in power if it has failed to check acts of terrorism and is too toothless to eliminate the radicals? Todate close to 4500 terrorists have been arrested by the govt, but it hasn’t penalized a single one of them. Terrorists were raised by the General Zia’s regime - some religious parties were assigned to create jihadists. To get dollars from the US, the successive govts abetted militancy - it was presented as a monster. Today, following in the footsteps of the caliph Ali, the govt should deal with the militants with an iron hand. Some paid govt functionaries and media persons chatter about the issue of my nationality to turn the general public against me. I have no business abroad. I have my home in Model Town Lahore, and don’t possess even an inch of land anywhere else in the world. My tehreek has created hundreds of educational institutes and an orphanage for the uplift of the whole nation. The rulers haven’t rebutted my pro-poor and egalitarian charter, but - out of jealousy - they are flinging dirt on my person. All the terrorist outfits enjoy the patronage of the government functionaries. The outfit that is reluctant to enter into peace talks and submit to the Constitution of Pakistan must be put to rout. Which Pakistani leader lives in the hearts of the people? If the people didn’t love me, they wouldn’t join the peace protest in absentia. The Pakistani rulers live in Pakistan, but their souls are overseas (their wealth is in the foreign countries). I led the Pakistani nation for thirty years, so even the children know me and hold me in love. General Musharraf’s accountability should start from his takeover in 99, not from 3 Nov 2007. Musharraf’s trial should include the one who abetted his coup - that is, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. All those bureaucrats who abetted General Musharraf should also be held and included in the investigation. Article 6 of the Constitution says that the coup stager and his abettors should be charged with high treason. Revolution is the need of the underclass - the affluent are not in need of it. Our revolution will come with the people’s power - no foreign power is behind us. In Pakistan, polls will bring true democracy only when the electoral system is first revamped.

I am waking up the people of Pakistan to snatch their rights from the corrupt rulers. If the govt provides livelihood, health care to the people, and its officials bring back their wealth from abroad, I’ll not give the call to revolution. The corrupt electoral system has deprived the people of Pakistan from their rights. The masses will overthrow it. The incumbent rulers have been making airy promises to the Pakistani nation for over 40 years. The revolution is inching towards its destination and will most certainly dawn. The call to revolution will not go beyond 2015. We’ll not let the country get ruined comprehensively. In India, Common Man’s Party won elections, and the leadership slashed the electricity tariffs by half. This is change. When the revolution occurs, we will start implementing reforms – promises made to the nation – straight away. The policies of the govt are pushing the nation to the dissolution of the country. In Pakistan, close 4500 terrorists have been freed by the govt. Here terrorists are secure while the whole nation is unsecure. My party, PAT, is working for the uplift of the disadvantaged. My party’s extensive social network shows I am very much present among people in Pakistan. The politicians in Pakistan are looting the nation’s wealth and sending it abroad. But they request the foreigners to invest money in Pakistan. We’ll join hands with any party that is ready to bring about change in Pakistan. I advise and recommend the heads of the political parties to be tolerant towards political opponents so that their followers may comport themselves in a manner which sets a good example. Former military chief Pervez Musharraf staged a coup in 1999. But why does the govt not open the trial of the general from 99? All the abettors of the former Pakistani president should be held accountable for backing up the general. Where the revival of economy is concerned, I want to introduce the economic reforms of the Prophet and the caliphs. Two hundred families have usurped the sources of the whole nation.ss	Exclusive Interview of Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri with Imran Khan in Takrar on Express News

In Pakistan, sectarian strife kicked off in 80s under the Zia regime. To resolve the issue of radicalism, first we need to fix who is responsible for aiding and abetting terrorism. Our past governments sponsored terrorist outfits. Why is the govt in power if it has failed to check acts of terrorism and is too toothless to eliminate the radicals? Todate close to 4500 terrorists have been arrested by the govt, but it hasn’t penalized a single one of them. Terrorists were raised by the General Zia’s regime - some religious parties were assigned to create jihadists. To get dollars from the US, the successive govts abetted militancy - it was presented as a monster. Today, following in the footsteps of the caliph Ali, the govt should deal with the militants with an iron hand. Some paid govt functionaries and media persons chatter about the issue of my nationality to turn the general public against me. I have no business abroad. I have my home in Model Town Lahore, and don’t possess even an inch of land anywhere else in the world. My tehreek has created hundreds of educational institutes and an orphanage for the uplift of the whole nation. The rulers haven’t rebutted my pro-poor and egalitarian charter, but - out of jealousy - they are flinging dirt on my person. All the terrorist outfits enjoy the patronage of the government functionaries. The outfit that is reluctant to enter into peace talks and submit to the Constitution of Pakistan must be put to rout. Which Pakistani leader lives in the hearts of the people? If the people didn’t love me, they wouldn’t join the peace protest in absentia. The Pakistani rulers live in Pakistan, but their souls are overseas (their wealth is in the foreign countries). I led the Pakistani nation for thirty years, so even the children know me and hold me in love. General Musharraf’s accountability should start from his takeover in 99, not from 3 Nov 2007. Musharraf’s trial should include the one who abetted his coup - that is, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. All those bureaucrats who abetted General Musharraf should also be held and included in the investigation. Article 6 of the Constitution says that the coup stager and his abettors should be charged with high treason. Revolution is the need of the underclass - the affluent are not in need of it. Our revolution will come with the people’s power - no foreign power is behind us. In Pakistan, polls will bring true democracy only when the electoral system is first revamped. For revolution, I’ll totally count on the disadvantaged segments of society - not any political party. To stage revolution in Pakistan, I’ll invite every party - which is for change and against terrorism - to join hands with me. Our revolution will not shed even one drop of blood - it will usher in a peaceful mega change.	Exclusive Interview of Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri with Nadeem Malik

But now that the mud has dried and he stands before the nation promising change, where do we the people stand? That’s what Kevin Ross and David McLaughlin are bent on finding out. And who better for the job than America’s best blog talkers? Last month, Kevin – an African-American Republican from Los Angeles – and David – a white Democrat from outside Atlanta – took top honors in FOX News Radio’s “Battle of the Blog Talkers.” Now, the odder-than-odd odd couple is teaming up for an unprecedented event.

Kicking off at 6 p.m. and running live until 12 a.m. ET, “Exit Poll ’08” will feature Farai Chideya, host of National Public Radio’s “News &amp; Notes,” and Rev.

Capturing the exhilarating behind-the-scenes world of graffiti art, an eccentric Frenchman tries to film and befriend Banksy, only for the artist to turn the camera back on its owner with spectacular results.

Featuring exclusive footage of Banksy, Shepard Fairey, Invader and many more of the world's most infamous graffiti artists at work, Exit Through The Gift Shop is the hilarious true story of low-level criminality, companionship and incompetence.

Giordano	aj@thedividingline.com	""	""	false	Join Gonzo as he explores the music of progressive artists that at times flirt with mainstream radio as well as mainstream acts that sometimes delve into progressive territory. Along with rock-oriented current and classic prog, neo-prog with crossover potential is heavily featured, often including bands such as Frost*, Spock.s Beard, Marillion and Porcupine Tree. For those who think prog is nothing but long, boring instrumentals from 1970, Experiments In Mass Appeal is here to expose you to the rapidly growing subgenre of accessible prog. A.J. grew up in Central New York at a time when it wasn.t unusual to hear Pink Floyd, Rush and Yes on the radio. Throw in rock bands with progressive roots like Styx, Kansas and Supertramp, and you have the foundation for A.J..s brand of prog. Always drawn to rock with that little something extra, he developed a love for music that straddles the line between rock and prog that endures to this day. His lifelong love of music led him to having a radio show in college and a degree in Broadcasting. Having discovered like-minded music fans and a vibrant progressive rock community online, he chose to join the Dividing Line family to again share his unique musical view with an audience. Tune in as Gonzo challenges your preconceptions of what prog is by presenting radio-worthy songs that are true Experiments In Mass Appeal.	Hosted by A.J. Giordano

Il est ainsi nécessaire d’expliquer leur signification de manière succincte. Ce sermon du vendredi donné par notre frère Fouad Abou Wiame dans la belle mosquée de Vauréal (Val-d’Oise) est une suite de réflexions concernant un de ces magnifiques noms d’Allah qui est Al-Hakîm (Le Sage par excellence). Le musulman doit savoir qu’Allah possède la plus haute Sagesse concernant sa création et son commandement. Il a parfait tout ce qu’il a créé : « Qu’y a-t-il de meilleur qu’Allah, en matière de jugement pour des gens qui ont une foi ferme ? » Ainsi, il n’a rien créé par frivolité, et rien n’est vain ni futile dans ce qu’il a légiféré. Il détient le jugement dans la vie d’ici-bas et à la fin des temps. Il possède les trois catégories de jugement qu’il ne partage avec aucun associé : il est Le Juge de ses serviteurs, concernant Sa Loi, Son Décret, Sa Rétribution. En outre, la Sagesse, consiste à placer les choses à leurs emplacements adéquats, et en leur accordant le statut qui leur revient.

Its topics are meant to connect ideas in the social sphere, broaden understanding of design’s role in business and innovation, evaluate shifts in design and culture, and champion beauty.

Our guests are often real people talking about their real experiences, helping us to untangle the mysteries gender creates “within” you and amongst us.  You’ll understand why husbands and wives live as intimate strangers; why men feel pressure to be “masculine”; why women internalize the “shame” of aging, weight and abuse, and many other gender mysteries which often control our lives. Our only freedom is knowing what it does, so we can undo the damage and recreate our lives in peace.  This conversation is the cure.  Get involved today, so you can look into the future with optimism.	The Best Internet Radio. The Future of Talk Radio. It&#039;s Web Talk Radio.

I am waking up the people of Pakistan to snatch their rights from the corrupt rulers. If the govt provides livelihood, health care to the people, and its officials bring back their wealth from abroad, I’ll not give the call to revolution. The corrupt electoral system has deprived the people of Pakistan from their rights. The masses will overthrow it. The incumbent rulers have been making airy promises to the Pakistani nation for over 40 years. The revolution is inching towards its destination and will most certainly dawn. The call to revolution will not go beyond 2015. We’ll not let the country get ruined comprehensively. In India, Common Man’s Party won elections, and the leadership slashed the electricity tariffs by half. This is change. When the revolution occurs, we will start implementing reforms – promises made to the nation – straight away. The policies of the govt are pushing the nation to the dissolution of the country. In Pakistan, close 4500 terrorists have been freed by the govt. Here terrorists are secure while the whole nation is unsecure. My party, PAT, is working for the uplift of the disadvantaged. My party’s extensive social network shows I am very much present among people in Pakistan. The politicians in Pakistan are looting the nation’s wealth and sending it abroad. But they request the foreigners to invest money in Pakistan. We’ll join hands with any party that is ready to bring about change in Pakistan. I advise and recommend the heads of the political parties to be tolerant towards political opponents so that their followers may comport themselves in a manner which sets a good example. Former military chief Pervez Musharraf staged a coup in 1999. But why does the govt not open the trial of the general from 99? All the abettors of the former Pakistani president should be held accountable for backing up the general. Where the revival of economy is concerned, I want to introduce the economic reforms of the Prophet and the caliphs. Two hundred families have usurped the sources of the whole nation.

EL FORMATO

 Nace como una página de internet y se transforma en programa de radio fresco, original y divertido, para luego saltar a la televisión con un formato innovador y terminología propia.

Basado en una finca rural especializada en Naranjas del País, que representan a los personajes más relevantes de nuestra sociedad, pone sobre la mesa un juego en el que estos son fumigados y exprimidos por jugosos colaboradores, salidos también del ámbito social y cultural isleño. Con ello es sencillo sacar de contexto a los invitados, al tiempo que se hace partícipe al público que nos sigue desde casa de un show desenfadado y muy nuestro, en el que ellos también serán protagonistas.

Artistas, políticos, periodistas… Los nombres más relevantes de Tenerife pasarán por nuestro programa acudiendo a la llamada de Alberto Castilla en esta producción sin complejos, que acercaremos a las calles de La Laguna a través del RETO EXPRIMECANARIAS, una sección que dará notoriedad al seguimiento del programa, del que esperamos muy buenos resultados. Tan buenos como los que obtiene nuestra red social Facebook, en la que nos hemos posicionados en los primeros puestos de audiencia en Canarias, con un alcance espectacular que esperamos respalde el proyecto."

Руководствуясь именно этой догмой, ExtraDJ.com вспомнил об одном из своих самых знаковых и интересных проектов, который родился буквально через год после создания вашего, надеемся, любимого сайта. Конечно же, речь идет об Extraordinary Show! На протяжении целых 2-х лет эта передача каждую неделю выходила в эфир радиостанции Kiss FM и радовала поклонников транс музыки эксклюзивными продюсерскими миксами от ключевых артистов жанра. Последний выпуск Extraordinary Show прозвучал на волнах “радио с танцами” 17 октября 2008 года. Последний, но не финальный...
		Все течет и все меняется, ExtraDJ.com - не исключение. Новый виток в истории развития нашего сайта, который происходит прямо сейчас, повлек за собой неминуемое возрождение полюбившего всем радиошоу в современном, удобном и информативном формате подкаста. Сохранив многие прелести радиопередачи, подкаст, все же, существенно отличается от Show.
		Итак, первой значимой особенностью подкаста станет его стилистическая независимость. Extraordinary будет представлять актуальных артистов самых разных жанров, начиная от хауса и транса и заканчивая драмнбэйсом, дабстэпом и экспериментальной электроникой. Никаких рамок - только хорошая и качественная музыка, в которой каждый слушатель найдет для себя что-то интересное!
		И второй особенностью Extraordinary Podcast станет то, что каждый выпуск будет сопровождаться эксклюзивным интервью с его героем(ями). В этом интервью ExtraDJ.com будет спрашивать артистов об их творчестве, обсуждать последние новости из мира электронной и танцевальной музыки, выяснять их точки зрения в глобальных дискуссиях и еще много всего."

Horrible one celled creatures disguised as normal human beings ! Well, at least that is what it seems to the author. Yes, The Eyes Have It is a whimsical story, making gentle fun of certain writing styles, but only a topflight science-fictionist like Philip Dick , we thought, could have written this story, in just this way. Tony and the Beetles takes place far in the future when Earth's enormous colonial empire is well established but the question is, how long can it last? 10 year old Tony grows up fast when history catches up with the human race. A sobering look at human history .. and our probable future. Two very different stories but both entertaining.  (Summary by the magazine editor and Phil Chenevert)	Aliens have invaded the earth!

He lived during the Hungarian revolution and his love of freedom meant his life was often in peril. She was his first love, this girl with the eyes like the sea. She was at heart noble, good and loving. What an excellent lady might have been made out of this woman, if she had only met with a husband who, in the most ordinary acceptance of the word, had been a good fellow, as is really the case with about nine men out of every ten. But she always managed to draw the unlucky tenth out of the urn of destiny. And so she spurned his true love in favor of a high-flying dandy. He went on to pursue a life of politics and she to follow her capricious heart. But yet, throughout her life, she kept returning to him and to the end, of all men, she loved him perhaps best of all.
